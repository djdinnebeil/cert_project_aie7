Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected. In addition, there were also concerns over the safety of soldiers at Camp Dix due to possible accidents. In testimony given regarding Amatol, Lieutenant Colonel R.H. Hawkins stated that Camp Dix was not selected “because the commanding officer of Camp Dix told us he did not want it near his soldiers.”\n",

To their surprise, they awoke to see a large force of strangers in their midst, a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend “Ordnance Department U.S.A.,” and heavy motor trucks noisily chugging in the streets.

In total, 1,600 acres had to be cleared for the plant, and 38 acres had to be cleared and 255 acres trimmed for the town. This was no easy task. The land was mostly wooded with some acres of swamp and was difficult to clear due to a “dense, tangled nature of growth.” The initial workforce included forty men, and within the first week, the first bunkhouse and mess hall were built.\n",

In an October 14 article, many of these soldiers decided to take French leave—an unauthorized departure—by traveling to Atlantic City. A few of the soldiers were jailed when they were unable to show “leave of absence.” By the time of the armistice, there were 3,800 officers and enlisted men at Camp Amatol, as it became known.\n",

Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected. In addition, there were also concerns over the safety of soldiers at Camp Dix due to possible accidents. In testimony given regarding Amatol, Lieutenant Colonel R.H. Hawkins stated that Camp Dix was not selected “because the commanding officer of Camp Dix told us he did not want it near his soldiers.”\n",

The Tuckerton Beacon reported that on March 2, 1918, the residents of Elwood and Hammonton went to bed with a quiet night as it had been any other. To their surprise, they awoke to see a large force of strangers in their midst, a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend “Ordnance Department U.S.A.,” and heavy motor trucks noisily chugging in the streets. The next day, March 4, construction began.\n",

Hammel in the Construction and Operation of a Shell Loading Plant and the Town of Amatol, New Jersey, commonly known as the “Amatol book”. In total, 1,600 acres had to be cleared for the plant, and 38 acres had to be cleared and 255 acres trimmed for the town. This was no easy task. The land was mostly wooded with some acres of swamp and was difficult to clear due to a “dense, tangled nature of growth.” The initial workforce included forty men, and within the first week, the first bunkhouse and mess hall were built.\n",

      "The safety features implemented at the Amatol munitions factory included the construction of multiple storage magazines for smokeless powder and T.N.T., as well as numerous storage buildings to contain and organize explosive materials and components. The plant was designed with separate magazines for different types of explosives to reduce the risk of accidental detonation and to enhance safety during loading and storage operations. Additionally, the plant's location and construction likely incorporated safety protocols typical of munitions manufacturing facilities of that era, such as controlled access, designated handling procedures, and separation of explosive materials to prevent chain reactions. However, specific detailed safety features beyond storage and organization are not explicitly described in the provided content.\n",

      "Loading operations at the Amatol plant began on July 31, 1918, and on August 3, the first shell was loaded. The plant was capable of loading “60,000 shells of all sizes, 50,000 boosters, 50,000 hand grenades, and 20,000 rifle grenades per day, as well as components. To accomplish this work there were 15 smokeless-powder magazines, 33 T.N.T. magazines, 49 miscellaneous storage buildings, 642 plant structures in all.” The plant, during its operational lifespan, loaded over 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition of various types and sizes. \n",
      "Although T.N.T. was preferred and used when available, amatol was used as an alternative due to the shortage of T.N.T. Amatol was “the main charge pressed into the shell (unless straight T.N.T. or a 50/50 mix was used), [and] contains 80 percent of ammonium nitrate and 20 percent of T.N.T.”. The one disadvantage of amatol was that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of a shell loaded with amatol was uncertain after five years while the life of a shell loaded with T.N.T. was indefinite, certainly at least 25 years. \n",
