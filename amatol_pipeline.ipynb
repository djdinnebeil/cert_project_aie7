When Elwoodians retired to rest last night they were surrounded by the quiet and calm that have characterized their community since the coming of the first settler.\\n\\nWhen they awoke today a large force of strangers had landed in their midst; their eyes beheld on the little-used side-track of the West Jersey & Seashore Railroad a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend, “Ordnance Department, U. S. A.,” and heavy motor trucks similarly decorated, chugged noisily about the quiet streets. ```\\n\\n```markdown Amazed at the transformation, and, with few exceptions entirely ignorant of its cause, the people immediately began diligent inquiries and were amazed to learn that their town had been chosen as the directing center of a great industrial project, the construction of which will begin tomorrow morning.\\n\\nThey learned that the strangers were made up of real estate men, whose work in securing the huge tract on which a shell-loading plant will stand has been practically completed; of construction workers in the employ of the Atlantic Loading Company, of New York, to which has been awarded the work of erecting the plant; and a force of engineers attached to the War Department. ```\\n\\n```markdown The Government representatives, they found, had come to talk business, and an hour after they had located Arthur Walker, proprietor of the Griswold Garden Tea Room, a favorite haunt for automobilists, they had bought the building and had begun the work of transforming it into a central office.\\n\\nDaniel B. Frazier, owner of a great part of the tract on which the new war industry will stand, worked diligently with J. B. Manly, of Somers Point, as his agent, among the few owners of the property who were holding out for bigger prices. They had practically completed their task before the day closed, and the word went out tonight that work on the great plant will positively begin tomorrow.\\n\\nTwo hundred men will arrive late tonight and this number will be increased to at least 1000 before tomorrow night. ```\\n\\n```markdown Options have been secured on the entire town of Elwood, including stores and residences, and the whole hamlet will in all probability be purchased by the big steel company behind the project for housing its thousands of employees during the construction of the plant.\\n\\nBuilding contractors visited the hamlet during the day, picking out the most desirable sites for barracks for workmen and other structures which will be used while the work of erection is going on.\\n\\nThe space on which the plant will be erected, made up for the most part of the Frazier and Jarmlusky tracts, is bounded in triangle shape by Hammonton, Elwood and Indian Mills, comprising several thousand acres. ```')"

It purchased 6000 acres of land a few miles east of Hammonton, NJ, and built a munitions plant and a town to house the 10,000-20,000 plant workers. The plant made munitions of many different types and sizes, and was called Amatol.\n",

Additionally, he mentioned that Amatol was situated between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, making it conveniently located, and it was built on a substantial safety zone of about 6,000 acres to protect the workers and the town from potential accidents at the plant.\n"
