            "The factory and its associated company town, which supported a population of around 10,000, exemplify how wartime industries were often rapidly established and developed to meet urgent military needs. However, following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, and with the armistice, the demand for munitions plummeted. As a result, the Amatol facility was quickly shuttered, its buildings dismantled, and the town vanished almost as swiftly as it had appeared. The swift dismantling of the facility highlights how wartime industries were often transient, constructed primarily for the duration of the conflict.\n",

            "The lasting impacts on the local community included the resettlement of many workers—primarily Irish and Polish laborers—who stayed in the area and started families. The site’s history has been thoroughly documented, especially given that it was fully recorded by the company that built it. Today, while the original site is abandoned, it is remembered through historical documentation and remains a symbol of wartime industrial efforts and their fleeting yet significant presence in local history.\n",

            "Prompt 11 | The Pennsylvania Railroad facilitated the rapid construction and operation of the shell loading plant near Hammonton, New Jersey, by providing efficient transportation and logistical support that enabled the quick transformation of the land and the establishment of the plant. According to the historical accounts, the Atlantic Loading Company began work on March 4, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, built a new town, and erected a large manufacturing plant. The railroad's infrastructure likely played a key role in delivering materials, machinery, and workers to the site, thereby supporting the quick development and operational readiness of the plant during 1918. |⏱️ 1.47s | Tokens 793 | Cost 0.000116\n",
