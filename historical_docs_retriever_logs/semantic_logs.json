When Elwoodians retired to rest last night they were surrounded by the quiet and calm that have characterized their community since the coming of the first settler. When they awoke today a large force of strangers had landed in their midst; their eyes beheld on the little-used side-track of the West Jersey & Seashore Railroad a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend, “Ordnance Department, U.

        "HAWKINS. Speaking first about the loading plant at Amatol, 25 miles from Atlantic City, we could not get people to go out there. We had to build rather attractive accommodations for them to get them there. It was very hard to get any there. We had to make it just as attractive as we could in order to get people to stay there; particularly in view of the knowledge of most people of the danger. The Morgan, N.J., plant blew all to pieces on the 4th of October, and we had all sorts of trouble getting people to work from that time on. And we had to take soldier labor and put soldiers in some of these plants. We had considerable labor at the plants after that explosion, and before that we were offering them every sort of inducement to get people to work in those plants, and we had to make it pretty attractive to them. MR. GRAHAM. You were paying the highest kind of wages? COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; paying good wages. MR. GRAHAM. And paying the demands that they made in the way of wages? COL. HAWKINS. We had to pay a lot. MR. GRAHAM. I think that is all. COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir. ",
        "SCOPE OF THE WORK\n\nIn April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers. The achievements of 1918 showed how well this work had been done in 1917. Once the lathes and the forges were working it became necessary to supply the high explosives with which to charge the shell they turned out, and to provide extensive machinery for doing the charging. Contracts were made for the production on a vast scale of trinitrotoluol, the destructive explosive used in modern big gun ammunition, and other contracts for the construction of plants for the loading of the shell as fast as the mills turned them out. Four large shell loading plants were projected and eventually placed in operation, namely, those of the Bethlehem Loading Co., the T. A. Gillespie Loading Co., the DuPont Engineering Co. and the Atlantic Loading Company. Of these the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company is the largest. It is located at Amatol, New Jersey—a town which came into being to house its workers, and is about 25 miles from Atlantic City, adjacent to and north of the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads. The site consists of a tract of approximately 6,000 acres of land, with its western boundary about six miles east of Hammonton, New Jersey. The history of the Atlantic Loading Company is a story of organization, construction and production in quick-step time. It entered into a contract with the Ordnance Department of the Government to act as its agent in loading and storing shell, and it conducted its work and enterprise from first to last in accordance with the rules and regulations of that department. It began the work of construction on its plant on March 4, 1918, began operations the following July, and in August loaded its first shell, and in the meantime it also had built the new town of Amatol. An indication of the high speed with which its operations were conducted may be found in the fact that within twenty-four hours after the site was finally determined upon, actual work on clearing the land for the plant was under way. The enterprise combined two separate and distinct undertakings, either of which in itself would require an organization embracing high skill, initiative and intensive working power. One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made ready to house the workers at the same time. It was in contemplation of this that the Atlantic Loading Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine in December, 1917. The stated purposes of the corporation were: first, to construct and operate a shell loading plant for the production of completed rounds of ammunition and to provide the necessary storage capacity therefor; second, to build a town for the housing of the operatives. The plant was designed to be the largest of its type in the country, providing for the loading of shell of all sizes from 75 mm, to 10-inch drop bombs, depth bombs, rifle grenades, hand grenades and boosters. The charter provisions were very broad, in order to permit the Company to enter into contracts for construction of any and all kinds, such as steam and electric railroads, manufacturing plants, electrical transmission lines, power developments, buildings and bridges. The Atlantic Loading Company is the tri-party control of O.",
        "Quite unexpectedly the necessities of war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil was easily worked and there was available a subterranean supply of excellent water readily tapped by driving wells. The moderate, healthful and equable climate was also suitable for a large industrial community. Early in the year 1918 the Company acquired for the Government a tract of 6000 acres of this land lying near the town of Hammonton, New Jersey. The Company began work on March 4th, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, laid out and built a new town and an enormous plant, peopled the former with workmen and equipped the latter with machinery and begun the loading of shell. The transformation of the wilderness into a hive of industry within such a short time was one of the many war-time marvels of American engineering achievement. The history of the work is a story of the accomplishment of brain power, engineering talent and the genius of American business organization, which reflects the highest credit upon all concerned.

The mass meeting was preceded this afternoon by a great street parade this afternoon, participated in by over a score of organizations, and several hundred soldiers who are employed in the munition plants at Belcoville and Amatol. The parade, which included a halfdozen bands, was headed by the City Commissioners and the United War Work Drive Committee. Atlantic County’s allotment in the present drive is $97,000, and a portion of this amount was raised at the big mass meeting at the Steel Pier tonight, where the utmost enthusiasm prevailed.",
        "At the beginning of March, 1918, the site of the plant was an unbroken tract, mostly wooded, with some acres of swamp. The land was of a kind peculiarly difficult to clear for building construction, owing to the dense, tangled nature of the growth. Nine months later it was covered with a plant which has turned out ammunition of many types in large quantities, including drop bombs and large shell; and in addition a town capable of properly housing over 10,000 people, with the many needed buildings for administration, auxiliary operation, recreation, etc., has been built. At the outset it was necessary to obtain carpenters and other workmen, lumber, commissary outfits and supplies. Within the first week the first bunkhouse and mess hall were up, housing and feeding an initial force of forty men. From the beginning the work expanded with ever-increasing rapidity, buildings going up almost over night. The speed in construction may be gauged by the fact that, during a period of nine months, the Company constructed an average of about four buildings of various kinds a day, from construction office up to such large structures as loading, administration, mess and dormitory buildings. Besides the building construction for plant and town there was a great amount of auxiliary construction, consisting in part of about fifty miles of standard gauge railroad track, water supply, sewerage systems, thirty miles of 66,000-volt transmission line and other power systems, telephone and telegraph systems, centralized heating plants and electric-lighting stations. It was because that the rapidity with which the plant was placed under way was in a large measure fundamental to the fact that the living conditions and the town were fundamentally correct. “Speed—simplicity—results” were the watchwords in the construction of plant and town, but nevertheless all structures were substantially built. Semi-fire-proof construction of stucco and “Composite” metal unit was determined upon; and it is an interesting fact that this durable type of building was successfully used at almost the same cost as ordinary cantonment construction—very little in excess of the cost of wood and, in many cases, cheaper. The use of fabricated steel structures, assembled in panels at the factory, facilitated erection and aided in the “record” completion of the 75 mm plant. Standardized unit “A” frame steel structures were also used. An inspection of the accompanying photographs will indicate the elasticity of this standardized construction. The units being bolted together, the structure can be wrecked and readily converted into a large variety of manufacturing buildings. This steel construction was adopted because of the salvage value of the material. The fact that stands out most sharply in connection with this vast enterprise is that while the Company has built substantially, it has also built quickly. Precisely what this has meant in physical construction is shown by the concrete figures given in the following statistical table:\n\nThese statistics cover the development as planned. The signing of the armistice caused the suspension of construction work and also some result some work for which material was purchased and delivered was not completed. About 90 per cent. of the construction was finished and in addition the actual loading of shell had been carried on for several months. Loading operations began July 31, 1918. First shell loaded (75 m. m.",

Evans, of the Evans Engineering Corporation, and the Electric Bond and Share Company, of New York, both of whom have had extensive experience in the financing and construction of large works. The new Company was formed by taking the pick of men from several large organizations, including that of the Electric Bond and Share Company, so that each of its men was made up of experts. This method of selecting suitable men was followed throughout the organization, the financial and administrative chiefs as well as the engineers being picked men. The new organization having in its personnel many of the pioneers in the quantity loading of high explosive shell, embodied in its plant at Amatol the best, most economical and safest methods which could be devised for facilitating and speeding up production. Some of these methods were developed by the Company's own engineers: the power belt conveyor system, which permits the continuous movement of shell through the various operations within the central loading building, is one feature. The men placed in charge of operating the plant thus brought to the work at Amatol the skill necessary to successful operation. The speed with which the call of the Government was met, the co-ordination of plant and men and the results obtained which provided for every contingency stand out as prominent features of the work. In the following pages Mr. Hammel, the Company's Chief Engineer, and a Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, has creditably presented an all-too-brief history of this great undertaking, which includes an interesting description of the plant and the town, their construction, operation, capacity, and the efficient organization which made them possible. It is eminently fitting that a permanent record should be made of the achievements of the Company, which may well be proud of its work, for success never attended a larger undertaking initiated and carried through in such a short time and in the face of so many difficulties.

        "Today, if you look closely, you can still see parts of Amatol... During World War I, a new explosive was invented by the British so that they could stretch their depleting supplies of TNT. This explosive was a mixture of TNT and another high explosive, and it was called Amatol. In 1917, the US entered the War. Then, in 1918, the US built a plant to supply munitions to the armed forces. It purchased 6000 acres of land a few miles east of Hammonton, NJ, and built a munitions plant and a town to house the 10,000-20,000 plant workers. The plant made munitions of many different types and sizes, and was called Amatol. The town of Amatol was built two miles away. This distance was to protect the workers and families in the event of an accident at the plant. This town was planned out well and was built quickly. It included a residential section consisting of houses, dormitories, bunk houses, schools and churches. The industrial section had water, electric and sewage plants. There was a bowling alley, swimming pool, YMCA, tennis courts, and a movie theater for entertainment. The Amatol Railroad was built to transport workers between the plant and town. When the war ended, the plant closed down and the town was deserted.",

        "It is the intention of this project to give new life to this wonderful document. Amatol Comes to Life\n\nThe United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance. In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen  incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine. The effect on local residents is best described in an article from a local newspaper of the time. The March 9, 1918 issue of the South Jersey Republican gives this account of the activity at the site:  \"Never in history was Hammonton so stirred up as on Sunday and Monday, when announcement was made that the Government had taken land four miles below here and proposed employing twenty thousand hands to erect buildings and load shells for war purposes. The papers were signed Saturday noon, and Sunday nearly a half hundred army trucks, loaded with tools, lumber and supplies, passed through town to the scene, at East Hammonton, this side of Elwood.\"\n\nConstruction\n\nConstruction on the plant began March 4, 1918. Two miles away from the plant site , the town that would house the workers, was also constructed. This distance would ensure the safety of the residents from any accidental explosions at the munition plant. This circumstance was dramatically demonstrated in the terrible accident at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lake Denmark, New Jersey in 1926. Both Amatol and Town-site were complete within nine months time. The plant was designed for safety and redundancy. The plant was laid out so that an explosion in one building should not damage any other buildings. This was accomplished by designing the buildings in such a way that an explosion would move upward rather than outward. Additional protection, in some cases, was provided with soil filled barricades. Hazardous operations were carried out in duplicate buildings so that if one were destroyed in an explosion the entire operation would not be jeopardized. The Plant\n\nAmatol was designed to load a whole series of shells. These ranged from 75 mm projectiles to hand grenades. The steel components were brought in by rail and distributed to a series of facilities designated to the loading of specific ordnance. In the book there is a photographic description of each one of these plants. There are also plans for the various buildings and for each plant which indicate the rail and conveyor connections among the buildings of the plant. These are the 75-mm plant, 4.7 inch plant, 6 inch plants, 8 inch plant, hand grenade plant, booster plant, and rifle grenade plant. Amatol was a great example of the newly emerging discipline of industrial organization. Though no direct attribution in given in the book to specific theorists of efficient industrial production a great emphasis is placed on the \"perfect organization, methods and equipment\" required to achieve the record production accomplished at Amatol. Plant Operation\n\nThe operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. :  \" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion...While the pressure of war needs was on it was necessary to load amatol rather than straight T.N.T.... The mix has as high explosive power as T.N.T., the one disadvantage of using it being that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of the shell loaded with straight T.N.T. is indefinite--certainly 25 years--while the condition of shell loaded with amatol would be uncertain after perhaps five years.\"\n\nPlant Safety\n\n\"In the matter of protection, the plant has been covered in many respects beyond the usual means of care to lessen risk.

        "All Aboard for Amatol, NJ\n\nAs a result of America’s entry into World War I, Atlantic County received a great expansion of its industrial economic base. The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed. In just nine months’ time, the new town and manufactory were completed reaching a population of 7,000. Today, the Pine Barrens have all but reclaimed the former site of Amatol. History\n\nThe history of Amatol begins in December 1917 with the incorporation of the Atlantic Loading Company. Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected. In addition, there were also concerns over the safety of soldiers at Camp Dix due to possible accidents. In testimony given regarding Amatol, Lieutenant Colonel R.H. Hawkins stated that Camp Dix was not selected “because the commanding officer of Camp Dix told us he did not want it near his soldiers.” \n\nOther sites were considered, including Toms River, Lakehurst, Lacey, and Hammonton. Ultimately, Hammonton was selected. Although no definite source can be cited as to why Hammonton was selected over the other three sites, major reasons did include the potential quality of town life and the design of a safety zone. Additional testimony by Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins reveals this consideration: “We had to build rather attractive accommodations at Amatol. We had to make it just as attractive as we could in order to get people to stay there; particularly in view of the knowledge of most people of the danger.” Being situated between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, Amatol was conveniently located for ease of access to the Jersey Shore and a great metropolitan city. In addition to town amenities, Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins also explained that the size of Amatol—6,000 acres—was meant as a “substantial safety zone.” \n\nConstruction and Development\n\nAfter the final determination of the site had been made, the Atlantic Loading Company immediately went to work, which caught neighboring towns by surprise. The Tuckerton Beacon reported that on March 2, 1918, the residents of Elwood and Hammonton went to bed with a quiet night as it had been any other. To their surprise, they awoke to see a large force of strangers in their midst, a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend “Ordnance Department U.S.A.,” and heavy motor trucks noisily chugging in the streets. The next day, March 4, construction began.",
        "GRAHAM. Did you build buildings there? COL. HAWKINS. We started a plant there in March, 1918, and we went into active operation in July, and very complete operations by the time the armistice was signed. Following that the plant was turned over to the commanding officer and it is now a permanent ordnance plant. MR. GRAHAM. Is it proposed to keep this permanently? COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; that was turned over to the commanding officer, Col. Miles, and he is doing a certain amount of loading there to-day. MR. GRAHAM. Loading what; shells? COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir. MR. GRAHAM. How many buildings do you have there? COL. HAWKINS. I have a very complete map at the office. MR.",
        "GRAHAM. Well, was that under some order of the Secretary of War, or somebody, that that was done? COL. HAWKINS. In November, I think it was, of 1917, Gen. Crozier submitted this to the General Staff, and my recollection is that the Secretary of War approved it, but did not approve it in writing. Later on, we got his written approval, in the latter part of 1918. MR. GRAHAM. From the Secretary of War? COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir. MR. GRAHAM. Was it after the armistice? COL. HAWKINS. No, sir; it was in September of 1918, I should think. But our original submission of the whole scheme was made in November of 1917, and the contracts were let to most of these companies on the 3rd of December, 1917, and the first one in operation that I recollect was the Gillespie Co. loading plant at Morgan, N.J., and the second one in operation was the Atlantic Loading Co. plant and the third the California loading plant; I am unable to state when the Penneman plant got into operation. MR. GRAHAM. Now, let us see about this loading plant. In times of peace is there any purpose for any such plant? COL.",
        "SCOPE OF THE WORK\n\nIn April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers. The achievements of 1918 showed how well this work had been done in 1917. Once the lathes and the forges were working it became necessary to supply the high explosives with which to charge the shell they turned out, and to provide extensive machinery for doing the charging. Contracts were made for the production on a vast scale of trinitrotoluol, the destructive explosive used in modern big gun ammunition, and other contracts for the construction of plants for the loading of the shell as fast as the mills turned them out. Four large shell loading plants were projected and eventually placed in operation, namely, those of the Bethlehem Loading Co., the T. A. Gillespie Loading Co., the DuPont Engineering Co. and the Atlantic Loading Company. Of these the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company is the largest. It is located at Amatol, New Jersey—a town which came into being to house its workers, and is about 25 miles from Atlantic City, adjacent to and north of the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads. The site consists of a tract of approximately 6,000 acres of land, with its western boundary about six miles east of Hammonton, New Jersey. The history of the Atlantic Loading Company is a story of organization, construction and production in quick-step time. It entered into a contract with the Ordnance Department of the Government to act as its agent in loading and storing shell, and it conducted its work and enterprise from first to last in accordance with the rules and regulations of that department. It began the work of construction on its plant on March 4, 1918, began operations the following July, and in August loaded its first shell, and in the meantime it also had built the new town of Amatol. An indication of the high speed with which its operations were conducted may be found in the fact that within twenty-four hours after the site was finally determined upon, actual work on clearing the land for the plant was under way. The enterprise combined two separate and distinct undertakings, either of which in itself would require an organization embracing high skill, initiative and intensive working power. One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made ready to house the workers at the same time. It was in contemplation of this that the Atlantic Loading Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine in December, 1917. The stated purposes of the corporation were: first, to construct and operate a shell loading plant for the production of completed rounds of ammunition and to provide the necessary storage capacity therefor; second, to build a town for the housing of the operatives. The plant was designed to be the largest of its type in the country, providing for the loading of shell of all sizes from 75 mm, to 10-inch drop bombs, depth bombs, rifle grenades, hand grenades and boosters. The charter provisions were very broad, in order to permit the Company to enter into contracts for construction of any and all kinds, such as steam and electric railroads, manufacturing plants, electrical transmission lines, power developments, buildings and bridges. The Atlantic Loading Company is the tri-party control of O."

The very nature of the work required an organization of experts. These were drafted from going concerns engaged in large construction and financial enterprises.

While the general residence section centers about Liberty Court, with its commercial shops and its commodious theatre, the offices occupy an area by themselves. Building Methods and Comfort\nThe method of construction of the buildings is, generally speaking, cement stucco on a composite metal lath, sometimes called \"brick lath.\" This lath is a mesh of steel wire, upon which brick clay has been pressed and baked so as to enclose the wire in brick or terra cotta while leaving the fabric flexible. It comes rolled in strips 40 inches in width and 16 feet in length. In the wall construction, the composite lath is nailed to the studding, which has previously been covered with a layer of weatherproof paper. The lath is then covered with stucco in the regular manner and the surface is finished. This wall construction gives an air space of four inches which provides effective insulation, making the buildings warmer in winter and cooler in summer. The interior partitions are plaster curtain walls, and, while their thickness is but 1½ inches, they have the necessary strength and the advantages of the standard wood partition. This means a saving of all studding and more floor room, giving a very great advantage in both economy and speed. Female Employment and Morale\nOne significant indication of the wisdom of building in a way to satisfy the standards of living of employees is given by the records of female employment. In the earliest stages of construction, when the housing conditions were limited and incomplete, the turnover of help among the women was considerably greater than it became when the dormitories were completed and equipped and the various phases of welfare work, such as recreation and entertainment, were fully organized. Indeed, through all departments the morale of the employees steadily improved and production quickened with the advancing improvement in living conditions until both reached the highest stage with the completion of housing quarters and facilities. Closing Reflection\nThe history of this community has again demonstrated that American labor wants not merely to exist, but to live; that upon living conditions is dependent enthusiasm for work; that to house workmen in buildings that are not both attractive and comfortable is a fundamental error.",

During wartime efforts at facilities like Amatol and other munition plants, significant efforts were made to improve living conditions, including building adequate housing, providing recreation facilities, and ensuring staff morale through welfare and entertainment programs. \n\nFor example, at the Amatol community, the construction of housing quarters and recreational facilities such as swimming pools, gymnasiums, theatres, and lounges was aimed at meeting these standards. The records show that when housing conditions were limited initially, employee turnover among women was higher, but it improved markedly once proper dormitories and welfare services were established, leading to higher morale and increased productivity.\n\nMoreover, workers required high wages and attractive accommodations to be incentivized to work in these wartime industries, especially given the dangers involved. Workers, including soldiers and civilians, were paid well and provided with attractive working and living environments to maintain efficiency and enthusiasm.\n\nOverall, the historical narrative demonstrates that improving living and working conditions was viewed as essential to maintaining labor productivity, morale, and enthusiasm, reinforcing the idea that American laborers valued not just employment but a quality of life that supported their well-being.",

Construction naturally was the first thing on the programme. In all construction the two main factors are labor and materials. Even in normal times these factors are difficult problems in any large undertaking. In the early part of the year 1918, with the whole country absorbed in war work and with normal conditions completely upset, they presented ten-fold more difficulties. To get labor with which to build its plant and town the Company was compelled to go into a labor market booming from unprecedented demand and to bid against high wages in all industries. But the problem was solved by making the work attractive and providing the best living and housing conditions for the workers.",

The lath is then covered with stucco in the regular manner and the surface is finished. This wall construction gives an air space of four inches which provides effective insulation, making the buildings warmer in winter and cooler in summer. The interior partitions are plaster curtain walls, and, while their thickness is but 1½ inches, they have the necessary strength and the advantages of the standard wood partition. This means a saving of all studding and more floor room, giving a very great advantage in both economy and speed. Female Employment and Morale\nOne significant indication of the wisdom of building in a way to satisfy the standards of living of employees is given by the records of female employment. In the earliest stages of construction, when the housing conditions were limited and incomplete, the turnover of help among the women was considerably greater than it became when the dormitories were completed and equipped and the various phases of welfare work, such as recreation and entertainment, were fully organized. Indeed, through all departments the morale of the employees steadily improved and production quickened with the advancing improvement in living conditions until both reached the highest stage with the completion of housing quarters and facilities. Closing Reflection\nThe history of this community has again demonstrated that American labor wants not merely to exist, but to live; that upon living conditions is dependent enthusiasm for work; that to house workmen in buildings that are not both attractive and comfortable is a fundamental error.",
        "ATLANTIC CITY NOTES Special to The Inquirer. ATLANTIC CITY, Jan. 11.—All construction work on the shell loading plants of the Bethlehem Steel Company, at Belleville, and the Atlantic Loading Company, at Amatol, came to a sudden standstill today, following the receipt of orders to that effect received late last night from Washington. Nearly two thousand men were suddenly thrown out of employment at the two plants when they appeared for work this morning. The Allied Building Trades’ Protective Association perfected permanent organization at a meeting last night. Its first official action was the passing of a resolution disapproving of the demand of striking mechanics for an increase in wages from $5 to $7 a day. W.",
        "SCOPE OF THE WORK\n\nIn April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers. The achievements of 1918 showed how well this work had been done in 1917. Once the lathes and the forges were working it became necessary to supply the high explosives with which to charge the shell they turned out, and to provide extensive machinery for doing the charging. Contracts were made for the production on a vast scale of trinitrotoluol, the destructive explosive used in modern big gun ammunition, and other contracts for the construction of plants for the loading of the shell as fast as the mills turned them out. Four large shell loading plants were projected and eventually placed in operation, namely, those of the Bethlehem Loading Co., the T. A. Gillespie Loading Co., the DuPont Engineering Co. and the Atlantic Loading Company. Of these the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company is the largest. It is located at Amatol, New Jersey—a town which came into being to house its workers, and is about 25 miles from Atlantic City, adjacent to and north of the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads. The site consists of a tract of approximately 6,000 acres of land, with its western boundary about six miles east of Hammonton, New Jersey. The history of the Atlantic Loading Company is a story of organization, construction and production in quick-step time. It entered into a contract with the Ordnance Department of the Government to act as its agent in loading and storing shell, and it conducted its work and enterprise from first to last in accordance with the rules and regulations of that department. It began the work of construction on its plant on March 4, 1918, began operations the following July, and in August loaded its first shell, and in the meantime it also had built the new town of Amatol. An indication of the high speed with which its operations were conducted may be found in the fact that within twenty-four hours after the site was finally determined upon, actual work on clearing the land for the plant was under way. The enterprise combined two separate and distinct undertakings, either of which in itself would require an organization embracing high skill, initiative and intensive working power. One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made ready to house the workers at the same time. It was in contemplation of this that the Atlantic Loading Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine in December, 1917. The stated purposes of the corporation were: first, to construct and operate a shell loading plant for the production of completed rounds of ammunition and to provide the necessary storage capacity therefor; second, to build a town for the housing of the operatives. The plant was designed to be the largest of its type in the country, providing for the loading of shell of all sizes from 75 mm, to 10-inch drop bombs, depth bombs, rifle grenades, hand grenades and boosters. The charter provisions were very broad, in order to permit the Company to enter into contracts for construction of any and all kinds, such as steam and electric railroads, manufacturing plants, electrical transmission lines, power developments, buildings and bridges. The Atlantic Loading Company is the tri-party control of O.",
        "It is the intention of this project to give new life to this wonderful document. Amatol Comes to Life\n\nThe United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance. In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen  incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine. The effect on local residents is best described in an article from a local newspaper of the time. The March 9, 1918 issue of the South Jersey Republican gives this account of the activity at the site:  \"Never in history was Hammonton so stirred up as on Sunday and Monday, when announcement was made that the Government had taken land four miles below here and proposed employing twenty thousand hands to erect buildings and load shells for war purposes. The papers were signed Saturday noon, and Sunday nearly a half hundred army trucks, loaded with tools, lumber and supplies, passed through town to the scene, at East Hammonton, this side of Elwood.\"\n\nConstruction\n\nConstruction on the plant began March 4, 1918. Two miles away from the plant site , the town that would house the workers, was also constructed. This distance would ensure the safety of the residents from any accidental explosions at the munition plant. This circumstance was dramatically demonstrated in the terrible accident at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lake Denmark, New Jersey in 1926. Both Amatol and Town-site were complete within nine months time. The plant was designed for safety and redundancy. The plant was laid out so that an explosion in one building should not damage any other buildings. This was accomplished by designing the buildings in such a way that an explosion would move upward rather than outward. Additional protection, in some cases, was provided with soil filled barricades. Hazardous operations were carried out in duplicate buildings so that if one were destroyed in an explosion the entire operation would not be jeopardized. The Plant\n\nAmatol was designed to load a whole series of shells. These ranged from 75 mm projectiles to hand grenades. The steel components were brought in by rail and distributed to a series of facilities designated to the loading of specific ordnance. In the book there is a photographic description of each one of these plants. There are also plans for the various buildings and for each plant which indicate the rail and conveyor connections among the buildings of the plant. These are the 75-mm plant, 4.7 inch plant, 6 inch plants, 8 inch plant, hand grenade plant, booster plant, and rifle grenade plant. Amatol was a great example of the newly emerging discipline of industrial organization. Though no direct attribution in given in the book to specific theorists of efficient industrial production a great emphasis is placed on the \"perfect organization, methods and equipment\" required to achieve the record production accomplished at Amatol. Plant Operation\n\nThe operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. :  \" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion...While the pressure of war needs was on it was necessary to load amatol rather than straight T.N.T.... The mix has as high explosive power as T.N.T., the one disadvantage of using it being that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of the shell loaded with straight T.N.T. is indefinite--certainly 25 years--while the condition of shell loaded with amatol would be uncertain after perhaps five years.\"\n\nPlant Safety\n\n\"In the matter of protection, the plant has been covered in many respects beyond the usual means of care to lessen risk. The operating buildings are practically all steel-frame with composite lath and cement construction or corrugated metal sides.",

        "Quite unexpectedly the necessities of war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil was easily worked and there was available a subterranean supply of excellent water readily tapped by driving wells. The moderate, healthful and equable climate was also suitable for a large industrial community. Early in the year 1918 the Company acquired for the Government a tract of 6000 acres of this land lying near the town of Hammonton, New Jersey. The Company began work on March 4th, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, laid out and built a new town and an enormous plant, peopled the former with workmen and equipped the latter with machinery and begun the loading of shell. The transformation of the wilderness into a hive of industry within such a short time was one of the many war-time marvels of American engineering achievement. The history of the work is a story of the accomplishment of brain power, engineering talent and the genius of American business organization, which reflects the highest credit upon all concerned. The leaders in the formation of the Atlantic Loading Company were O.",
        "The isolated community swelled with workers who inhabited a new downtown with such amenities as a cafeteria, dance hall, and movie theater. World War I ended on Nov. 11, 1918 — Armistice Day, later commemorated as Veterans Day — and the 6,000-acre facility was soon shuttered, its buildings dismantled as swiftly as they’d been built. What little remained fell to ruin or was scrapped. Many of Amatol’s laborers, predominantly Irish and Polish from Philadelphia, stayed in the area and started families. Time, of course, has taken its toll on Amatol. Contracted by the federal government amid a world war the allies feared losing, it was built almost simultaneously with the better-known Bethlehem Loading Co. — or Belcoville — a munitions factory whose ruins are now part of the Atlantic County Park in Estell Manor. The Atlantic Loading Co. transformed a swath of the Pinelands into a grid of streets. Its name came from the type of explosive used in munitions. Mullica Township was chosen for its proximity to the rail line that ran from Philadelphia to Atlantic City and its relative isolation. At the time, the area was sparsely populated, an advantage in the event of an explosion at the plant. According to historical records, the workers’ city was sited two miles away from the factory in case of an explosion. Only two buildings from Amatol are still standing: the administration building became the now-abandoned State Police barracks outside Hammonton, and one of the houses was moved to the White Horse Pike, where it’s still occupied. Interestingly, many of Amatol’s buildings were designed to be temporary. The privately owned forest land behind the township’s recreational fields are strewn with bits of brick, concrete, and terra cotta — the materials used to construct these temporary structures. “That’s the cheap lath they made to separate the rooms,” Benner said. “It was plaster over wire mesh. When they disintegrated, (the plaster) fell out of the wire mesh.”\n\nThe Atlantic County Utilities Authority considered building a landfill on the Amatol site in the mid-1980s, but the proposal ultimately died in part because of potential environmental impacts and an organized opposition by township residents. Amatol is a story in itself."

        "At the beginning of March, 1918, the site of the plant was an unbroken tract, mostly wooded, with some acres of swamp. The land was of a kind peculiarly difficult to clear for building construction, owing to the dense, tangled nature of the growth. Nine months later it was covered with a plant which has turned out ammunition of many types in large quantities, including drop bombs and large shell; and in addition a town capable of properly housing over 10,000 people, with the many needed buildings for administration, auxiliary operation, recreation, etc., has been built. At the outset it was necessary to obtain carpenters and other workmen, lumber, commissary outfits and supplies. Within the first week the first bunkhouse and mess hall were up, housing and feeding an initial force of forty men. From the beginning the work expanded with ever-increasing rapidity, buildings going up almost over night. The speed in construction may be gauged by the fact that, during a period of nine months, the Company constructed an average of about four buildings of various kinds a day, from construction office up to such large structures as loading, administration, mess and dormitory buildings. Besides the building construction for plant and town there was a great amount of auxiliary construction, consisting in part of about fifty miles of standard gauge railroad track, water supply, sewerage systems, thirty miles of 66,000-volt transmission line and other power systems, telephone and telegraph systems, centralized heating plants and electric-lighting stations. It was because that the rapidity with which the plant was placed under way was in a large measure fundamental to the fact that the living conditions and the town were fundamentally correct. “Speed—simplicity—results” were the watchwords in the construction of plant and town, but nevertheless all structures were substantially built. Semi-fire-proof construction of stucco and “Composite” metal unit was determined upon; and it is an interesting fact that this durable type of building was successfully used at almost the same cost as ordinary cantonment construction—very little in excess of the cost of wood and, in many cases, cheaper. The use of fabricated steel structures, assembled in panels at the factory, facilitated erection and aided in the “record” completion of the 75 mm plant. Standardized unit “A” frame steel structures were also used. An inspection of the accompanying photographs will indicate the elasticity of this standardized construction. The units being bolted together, the structure can be wrecked and readily converted into a large variety of manufacturing buildings. This steel construction was adopted because of the salvage value of the material. The fact that stands out most sharply in connection with this vast enterprise is that while the Company has built substantially, it has also built quickly. Precisely what this has meant in physical construction is shown by the concrete figures given in the following statistical table:\n\nThese statistics cover the development as planned. The signing of the armistice caused the suspension of construction work and also some result some work for which material was purchased and delivered was not completed. About 90 per cent. of the construction was finished and in addition the actual loading of shell had been carried on for several months. Loading operations began July 31, 1918.

This circumstance was dramatically demonstrated in the terrible accident at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lake Denmark, New Jersey in 1926. Both Amatol and Town-site were complete within nine months time. The plant was designed for safety and redundancy. The plant was laid out so that an explosion in one building should not damage any other buildings. This was accomplished by designing the buildings in such a way that an explosion would move upward rather than outward. Additional protection, in some cases, was provided with soil filled barricades. Hazardous operations were carried out in duplicate buildings so that if one were destroyed in an explosion the entire operation would not be jeopardized. The Plant\n\nAmatol was designed to load a whole series of shells. These ranged from 75 mm projectiles to hand grenades. The steel components were brought in by rail and distributed to a series of facilities designated to the loading of specific ordnance. In the book there is a photographic description of each one of these plants. There are also plans for the various buildings and for each plant which indicate the rail and conveyor connections among the buildings of the plant. These are the 75-mm plant, 4.7 inch plant, 6 inch plants, 8 inch plant, hand grenade plant, booster plant, and rifle grenade plant. Amatol was a great example of the newly emerging discipline of industrial organization. Though no direct attribution in given in the book to specific theorists of efficient industrial production a great emphasis is placed on the \"perfect organization, methods and equipment\" required to achieve the record production accomplished at Amatol. Plant Operation\n\nThe operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. :  \" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion...While the pressure of war needs was on it was necessary to load amatol rather than straight T.N.T.... The mix has as high explosive power as T.N.T., the one disadvantage of using it being that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of the shell loaded with straight T.N.T. is indefinite--certainly 25 years--while the condition of shell loaded with amatol would be uncertain after perhaps five years.\"\n\nPlant Safety\n\n\"In the matter of protection, the plant has been covered in many respects beyond the usual means of care to lessen risk. The operating buildings are practically all steel-frame with composite lath and cement construction or corrugated metal sides."

      "question": "How did the company town and community development of Amatol relate to its town planning and the safety measures implemented during its construction?",
      "response": "The company town and community development of Amatol were closely related to its town planning and safety measures during construction, emphasizing both efficiency and protection. The planning was meticulous, aiming for a well-structured and attractive environment that balanced quick construction with safety and comfort. For example, the town was designed on the basis of a possible population of 25,000, with houses built for rapid assembly yet resistant to weather, and the industrial and residential sections were strategically organized.\n\nSafety was a primary concern in the town’s planning. The town was located about two miles from the munitions plant to serve as a significant safety zone in case of accidents at the explosive manufacturing facility. The layout of the plant itself was designed to minimize risks, with buildings arranged so that explosions would move upward rather than outward, and some operations were duplicated in separate buildings to ensure continuity if a part of the plant was damaged. Additionally, construction materials and methods focused on safety, with steel-frame buildings and special barricades to protect against potential blasts.\n\nOverall, the development of Amatol reflected a comprehensive approach where town planning integrated safety measures to protect residents from the hazards of the munitions factory, while the community layout was designed for efficiency, attractiveness, and rapid housing of workers, all underpinning the wartime urgency and safety considerations.",

        "THE TOWN OF AMATOL\n\nThe town of Amatol, which is named after one of the explosives used in the plant, covers a tract of about 350 acres lying to the northeast of the plant. A distance of upward of two miles separates the closest points between town and plant. The town is located on a natural eminence, a few miles distant from the famous New Jersey coast resorts and is within the territory that comes under the influence of the Gulf Stream. The wood growth is largely the pines that have given to this section its reputation for healthfulness; and in clearing the land for the town, most of these trees, together with oaks, have been left standing. The industrial section of the town was made a long, narrow block reaching well in toward the center, and in this was built one branch of the railroad, all of the warehouses, the material storage yards, garages, heating plant, laundry, wood working shop and similar commercial structures. The impression given by a first view of Amatol is that of a well-kept suburban settlement. The town was not thrown together merely to put roofs and walls around its working people at night, but was built to keep its population satisfied with its surroundings and living conditions and tuned for the rapid production for which the establishment was designed. The town was planned on a basis of a possible population of 25,000. The houses were designed for speedy construction, yet planned to resist weather—the quickest, most economical construction capable of affording comfort and protection. The first impressive view of Liberty Court as one enters the town through West J Street is the keynote of the complete scheme. In the planning of the town thought was given to its general attractiveness as well as to the quick housing of its people.",
        "All Aboard for Amatol, NJ\n\nAs a result of America’s entry into World War I, Atlantic County received a great expansion of its industrial economic base. The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed. In just nine months’ time, the new town and manufactory were completed reaching a population of 7,000. Today, the Pine Barrens have all but reclaimed the former site of Amatol. History\n\nThe history of Amatol begins in December 1917 with the incorporation of the Atlantic Loading Company. Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected. In addition, there were also concerns over the safety of soldiers at Camp Dix due to possible accidents. In testimony given regarding Amatol, Lieutenant Colonel R.H. Hawkins stated that Camp Dix was not selected “because the commanding officer of Camp Dix told us he did not want it near his soldiers.” \n\nOther sites were considered, including Toms River, Lakehurst, Lacey, and Hammonton. Ultimately, Hammonton was selected. Although no definite source can be cited as to why Hammonton was selected over the other three sites, major reasons did include the potential quality of town life and the design of a safety zone. Additional testimony by Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins reveals this consideration: “We had to build rather attractive accommodations at Amatol. We had to make it just as attractive as we could in order to get people to stay there; particularly in view of the knowledge of most people of the danger.” Being situated between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, Amatol was conveniently located for ease of access to the Jersey Shore and a great metropolitan city. In addition to town amenities, Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins also explained that the size of Amatol—6,000 acres—was meant as a “substantial safety zone.” \n\nConstruction and Development\n\nAfter the final determination of the site had been made, the Atlantic Loading Company immediately went to work, which caught neighboring towns by surprise. The Tuckerton Beacon reported that on March 2, 1918, the residents of Elwood and Hammonton went to bed with a quiet night as it had been any other. To their surprise, they awoke to see a large force of strangers in their midst, a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend “Ordnance Department U.S.A.,” and heavy motor trucks noisily chugging in the streets. The next day, March 4, construction began.",
        "Today, if you look closely, you can still see parts of Amatol... During World War I, a new explosive was invented by the British so that they could stretch their depleting supplies of TNT. This explosive was a mixture of TNT and another high explosive, and it was called Amatol. In 1917, the US entered the War. Then, in 1918, the US built a plant to supply munitions to the armed forces. It purchased 6000 acres of land a few miles east of Hammonton, NJ, and built a munitions plant and a town to house the 10,000-20,000 plant workers. The plant made munitions of many different types and sizes, and was called Amatol. The town of Amatol was built two miles away. This distance was to protect the workers and families in the event of an accident at the plant. This town was planned out well and was built quickly. It included a residential section consisting of houses, dormitories, bunk houses, schools and churches. The industrial section had water, electric and sewage plants. There was a bowling alley, swimming pool, YMCA, tennis courts, and a movie theater for entertainment. The Amatol Railroad was built to transport workers between the plant and town. When the war ended, the plant closed down and the town was deserted.",
        "The isolated community swelled with workers who inhabited a new downtown with such amenities as a cafeteria, dance hall, and movie theater. World War I ended on Nov. 11, 1918 — Armistice Day, later commemorated as Veterans Day — and the 6,000-acre facility was soon shuttered, its buildings dismantled as swiftly as they’d been built. What little remained fell to ruin or was scrapped. Many of Amatol’s laborers, predominantly Irish and Polish from Philadelphia, stayed in the area and started families. Time, of course, has taken its toll on Amatol. Contracted by the federal government amid a world war the allies feared losing, it was built almost simultaneously with the better-known Bethlehem Loading Co. — or Belcoville — a munitions factory whose ruins are now part of the Atlantic County Park in Estell Manor. The Atlantic Loading Co. transformed a swath of the Pinelands into a grid of streets. Its name came from the type of explosive used in munitions. Mullica Township was chosen for its proximity to the rail line that ran from Philadelphia to Atlantic City and its relative isolation. At the time, the area was sparsely populated, an advantage in the event of an explosion at the plant. According to historical records, the workers’ city was sited two miles away from the factory in case of an explosion. Only two buildings from Amatol are still standing: the administration building became the now-abandoned State Police barracks outside Hammonton, and one of the houses was moved to the White Horse Pike, where it’s still occupied. Interestingly, many of Amatol’s buildings were designed to be temporary. The privately owned forest land behind the township’s recreational fields are strewn with bits of brick, concrete, and terra cotta — the materials used to construct these temporary structures. “That’s the cheap lath they made to separate the rooms,” Benner said. “It was plaster over wire mesh. When they disintegrated, (the plaster) fell out of the wire mesh.”\n\nThe Atlantic County Utilities Authority considered building a landfill on the Amatol site in the mid-1980s, but the proposal ultimately died in part because of potential environmental impacts and an organized opposition by township residents. Amatol is a story in itself.",
        "By June, the population was nearly 2,000, and train service was added. By August, advertisements for Amatol described it as “a city with all modern improvements with electric lights, a fire department, a police department, a modern sewage system, a modern water plant, a theatre, a Y.M.C.A, an auditorium, bowling alleys, and other city amenities.” Amatol also promised many employment opportunities, not just with the munitions plant, but with local businesses, like barbers, tailors, jewelers, watchmakers, and grocers. By the signing of the armistice, plant and town structures included: 122 loading buildings, 159 storage buildings and magazines, 4 administration buildings, 6 office buildings, 22 industrial buildings, 7 hospitals, 16 recreation centers, 1 theatre, 18 mess halls, 4 garages, 15 warehouses, 21 railroad structures, 12 stables, 130 guardhouses, sentry boxes, searchlights, etc., 21 commercial stores, 98 male dormitories and bunkhouses, 21 female dormitories, 140 miscellaneous buildings, 24 Army barracks, 4 Y.M.C.A.’s, 11 individual residences, 33 multiple houses, 227 workmen’s houses, 1 post office, 1 school house, 2 fire houses, 444 tent tops, 96 two-roomed family apartments, 179 four-roomed family apartments, 23 three-roomed family apartments. On average, there were four buildings built per day, which was a remarkable speed. The final workforce included over 5,000 construction workers. The town reached a peak population of 7,000, had the capacity to house over 10,000, and was planned to accommodate a possible population of 25,000. Amatol Plant\n\nLoading operations at the Amatol plant began on July 31, 1918, and on August 3, the first shell was loaded. The plant was capable of loading “60,000 shells of all sizes, 50,000 boosters, 50,000 hand grenades, and 20,000 rifle grenades per day, as well as components. To accomplish this work there were 15 smokeless-powder magazines, 33 T.N.T. magazines, 49 miscellaneous storage buildings, 642 plant structures in all.” The plant, during its operational lifespan, loaded over 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition of various types and sizes. Although T.N.T. was preferred and used when available, amatol was used as an alternative due to the shortage of T.N.T. Amatol was “the main charge pressed into the shell (unless straight T.N.T. or a 50/50 mix was used), [and] contains 80 percent of ammonium nitrate and 20 percent of T.N.T.”. The one disadvantage of amatol was that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of a shell loaded with amatol was uncertain after five years while the life of a shell loaded with T.N.T. was indefinite, certainly at least 25 years. The Army’s Ordnance Department took over the plant in February 1919 and denominated it Amatol Arsenal. By 1923, Amatol Arsenal ceased operations. Camp Amatol\n\nIn October 1918, 2,400 troops arrived at Amatol to assist in operations there. Their job was to bring the output to full loading capacity and they would even perform civilian tasks. In an October 14 article, many of these soldiers decided to take French leave—an unauthorized departure—by traveling to Atlantic City. A few of the soldiers were jailed when they were unable to show “leave of absence.” By the time of the armistice, there were 3,800 officers and enlisted men at Camp Amatol, as it became known. There were also Camp Amatol sports teams. Basketball was a big sport played amongst soldiers, including officers. A December 6, 1918 article records, “the Hammonton five defeated the U.S. Ordnance quintet from Camp Amatol by the score of 19 to 10.” A December 13, 1918 article describes how the U.S. Ordnance Officers team defeated the Amatol team in basketball by the score of 25 to 10. Conclusion\n\nIn just a matter of months after signing the Armistice, the population of Amatol had virtually vanished, with only a few hundred remaining there. The former munitions complex experienced a brief resurgence in 1926 after an investor backed the construction of the Atlantic City Speedway there. The revival was short-lived as interest quickly waned among the visiting public and other investors. Little remains of Amatol today. After a hike through the Pine Barrens, remnants of the munitions plant, town, and racetrack can be found at the former site of Amatol. Of the many buildings and homes that were constructed, only two still remain: the now-abandoned State Police barracks outside of Hammonton and one house, which was moved to the White Horse Pike, where it is still occupied. During the 1980s, the Amatol site was considered for a landfill, but the proposal was shot down due to environmental concerns and an opposition by local residents. Recently, in 2017, more than 500 acres of Amatol (now the Pine Barrens) were preserved. Amatol was not the only planned community that South Jersey saw built during World War I. Belcoville, Atlantic County, was also built as a munitions plant and village. Yorkship Village (now Fairview), Camden County, was built to house shipyard workers and their families. In addition, America also saw many new military bases built, which included Camp Dix (now Fort Dix), Burlington County. What was the overall impact of Amatol on the surrounding area?",
        "A detailed description of the construction is recorded by Victor F. Hammel in the Construction and Operation of a Shell Loading Plant and the Town of Amatol, New Jersey, commonly known as the “Amatol book”. In total, 1,600 acres had to be cleared for the plant, and 38 acres had to be cleared and 255 acres trimmed for the town.",
        "TOWN ADMINISTRATION\n\nThe administration of the town of Amatol is under the direction of the Town Manager, whose office and duties correspond to those of a mayor or chief burgess. Under him are the various operating divisions headed by the Town Superintendent, the Renting Agent and the Commissary Superintendent. Their work broadly covers the operation and maintenance of those public utilities associated with the town—housing and renting, town accounting, education and the commissary management of the entire development for the plant as well as for the town. During the construction period the commissary came under the jurisdiction of the Town Superintendent, but when the various divisions of public service were completed and turned over to the town management for operation, the commissary became a separate division reporting directly to the Town Manager. The duties of the Town Superintendent include the important subdivision of housing of mechanics and laborers, police and fire protection, maintenance and operation of the water supply, sewerage system, town lighting, steam heating, garbage disposal and sanitation. The sanitation of town and camps is being conducted under the direction of the Chief Surgeon and a sanitary engineer, who report weekly on sanitary conditions. The country-wide influenza outbreak in 1918 added a big load to the health and sanitation work, more particularly because of the fact that many employees lived outside the town. The importance of uninterrupted production in the various plants made this work vital. Upon direct comment by one of the highest medical department authorities on the methods of the influenza epidemic the total cases reported from the army for the month of October was 500,000, with 26,000 deaths. The deaths from influenza during the three months here were only 15 or the 2.02 per cent.",
        "During the planning and construction of Amatol, the motto was 'Speed—simplicity—results', which served as a guiding principle.",
        "Amatol Munitions Factory\nAmatol is an abandoned munitions factory and\nassociated company town, located just a few\nmiles east of Hammonton. Constructed by the\nAtlantic Shell Loading Company, Amatol\nderives its name from the explosive loaded into\nthe shell as an accelerant for the projectile. In 1918, a year after the United States entered\nWorld War I, the government purchased 6,000\nacres of land to build a munitions plant and town. The speedy design and extensive use of concrete\nconstruction at Amatol was a major urban\nplanning achievement. In the span of nine\nmonths, the contractor completed houses,\ndormitories, bunk houses, schools, and other\nfacilities to accommodate between 10,000-\n20,000 plant workers and their families. The\nAmatol Railroad served to transport workers from their town to the factories located two miles away as\nwell as make connections with the West Jersey & Seashore Railroad. The plant closed down after the war ended and the federal government ordered a series of auctions for\neverything from the equipment in the manufacturing facilities to the buildings in the town between the\nyears 1919 and 1924. Within five years, the town and plant became a virtual memory, with just remnants of\nconcrete found throughout the site and the extant office building along the White Horse Pike, which later\nserved as a New Jersey State Police barracks. Amatol received a second chance when Charles Schwab bought the land in 1926 to construct a “wooden\nbowl” speedway. The wooden and oval track measured one and one-half miles long. Although it received\nhigh attendance at the opening, the racetrack only remained open for two years. Schwab leased the site as a\ntest track to automobile companies after losing interest in racing. Currently, the Mullica Township Recreation Association has taken over a portion of the site. Only one\nbuilding remains intact from the facility.",
        "It is the intention of this project to give new life to this wonderful document. Amatol Comes to Life\n\nThe United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance. In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen  incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine. The effect on local residents is best described in an article from a local newspaper of the time. The March 9, 1918 issue of the South Jersey Republican gives this account of the activity at the site:  \"Never in history was Hammonton so stirred up as on Sunday and Monday, when announcement was made that the Government had taken land four miles below here and proposed employing twenty thousand hands to erect buildings and load shells for war purposes. The papers were signed Saturday noon, and Sunday nearly a half hundred army trucks, loaded with tools, lumber and supplies, passed through town to the scene, at East Hammonton, this side of Elwood.\"\n\nConstruction\n\nConstruction on the plant began March 4, 1918. Two miles away from the plant site , the town that would house the workers, was also constructed. This distance would ensure the safety of the residents from any accidental explosions at the munition plant. This circumstance was dramatically demonstrated in the terrible accident at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lake Denmark, New Jersey in 1926. Both Amatol and Town-site were complete within nine months time. The plant was designed for safety and redundancy. The plant was laid out so that an explosion in one building should not damage any other buildings. This was accomplished by designing the buildings in such a way that an explosion would move upward rather than outward. Additional protection, in some cases, was provided with soil filled barricades. Hazardous operations were carried out in duplicate buildings so that if one were destroyed in an explosion the entire operation would not be jeopardized. The Plant\n\nAmatol was designed to load a whole series of shells. These ranged from 75 mm projectiles to hand grenades. The steel components were brought in by rail and distributed to a series of facilities designated to the loading of specific ordnance. In the book there is a photographic description of each one of these plants. There are also plans for the various buildings and for each plant which indicate the rail and conveyor connections among the buildings of the plant. These are the 75-mm plant, 4.7 inch plant, 6 inch plants, 8 inch plant, hand grenade plant, booster plant, and rifle grenade plant. Amatol was a great example of the newly emerging discipline of industrial organization. Though no direct attribution in given in the book to specific theorists of efficient industrial production a great emphasis is placed on the \"perfect organization, methods and equipment\" required to achieve the record production accomplished at Amatol. Plant Operation\n\nThe operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. :  \" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion...While the pressure of war needs was on it was necessary to load amatol rather than straight T.N.T.... The mix has as high explosive power as T.N.T., the one disadvantage of using it being that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of the shell loaded with straight T.N.T. is indefinite--certainly 25 years--while the condition of shell loaded with amatol would be uncertain after perhaps five years.\"\n\nPlant Safety\n\n\"In the matter of protection, the plant has been covered in many respects beyond the usual means of care to lessen risk. The operating buildings are practically all steel-frame with composite lath and cement construction or corrugated metal sides."

      "question": "How did the wartime industrial production at amatol relate to the us involvement in WW1 and how did the town planning support the war effort?",
      "response": "The wartime industrial production at Amatol was closely related to the United States' involvement in World War I. When the US entered the war in 1917, there was a critical need to ramp up munitions production to support military efforts. In response, a large munitions plant was constructed in 1918 on a 6,000-acre site near Hammonton, NJ, dedicated to loading shells and producing various ammunition types. Amatol, a mixture of ammonium nitrate and T.N.T., served as the main explosive charge in shells, supplementing the shortage of T.N.T. and enabling increased munitions output, with the plant capable of loading over 9 million rounds of ammunition during its operational period.\n\nThe rapid industrial development was a significant contribution to the war effort, providing essential munitions for Allied forces. The plant’s construction was swift, completing in just nine months, and employed thousands of workers, including a peak workforce of over 5,000 construction workers, and hosted a town designed to accommodate up to 25,000 residents with extensive amenities to support the workforce.\n\nTown planning played a vital role in supporting the war effort by ensuring safety, efficiency, and worker welfare. The town of Amatol was deliberately built two miles away from the plant to protect residents from potential explosions—a crucial safety measure given the hazardous nature of explosive manufacturing. It was well-planned with residential areas, schools, churches, entertainment facilities (such as a theater, swimming pools, YMCA), and infrastructure like water, electric, and sewage systems, creating a comfortable living environment for workers and their families. The town's design emphasized speed of construction and safety, with buildings constructed swiftly yet to withstand weather and, where necessary, featuring protective soil barricades.\n\nIn summary, the wartime industrial production at Amatol was a direct response to US involvement in WWI, significantly boosting munitions output, while the town’s meticulous planning supported this effort by providing a safe, efficient, and worker-friendly environment that helped sustain the war-driven industrial demand.",

        "Today, if you look closely, you can still see parts of Amatol... During World War I, a new explosive was invented by the British so that they could stretch their depleting supplies of TNT. This explosive was a mixture of TNT and another high explosive, and it was called Amatol. In 1917, the US entered the War. Then, in 1918, the US built a plant to supply munitions to the armed forces. It purchased 6000 acres of land a few miles east of Hammonton, NJ, and built a munitions plant and a town to house the 10,000-20,000 plant workers. The plant made munitions of many different types and sizes, and was called Amatol. The town of Amatol was built two miles away. This distance was to protect the workers and families in the event of an accident at the plant. This town was planned out well and was built quickly. It included a residential section consisting of houses, dormitories, bunk houses, schools and churches. The industrial section had water, electric and sewage plants. There was a bowling alley, swimming pool, YMCA, tennis courts, and a movie theater for entertainment. The Amatol Railroad was built to transport workers between the plant and town. When the war ended, the plant closed down and the town was deserted.",
        "By June, the population was nearly 2,000, and train service was added. By August, advertisements for Amatol described it as “a city with all modern improvements with electric lights, a fire department, a police department, a modern sewage system, a modern water plant, a theatre, a Y.M.C.A, an auditorium, bowling alleys, and other city amenities.” Amatol also promised many employment opportunities, not just with the munitions plant, but with local businesses, like barbers, tailors, jewelers, watchmakers, and grocers. By the signing of the armistice, plant and town structures included: 122 loading buildings, 159 storage buildings and magazines, 4 administration buildings, 6 office buildings, 22 industrial buildings, 7 hospitals, 16 recreation centers, 1 theatre, 18 mess halls, 4 garages, 15 warehouses, 21 railroad structures, 12 stables, 130 guardhouses, sentry boxes, searchlights, etc., 21 commercial stores, 98 male dormitories and bunkhouses, 21 female dormitories, 140 miscellaneous buildings, 24 Army barracks, 4 Y.M.C.A.’s, 11 individual residences, 33 multiple houses, 227 workmen’s houses, 1 post office, 1 school house, 2 fire houses, 444 tent tops, 96 two-roomed family apartments, 179 four-roomed family apartments, 23 three-roomed family apartments. On average, there were four buildings built per day, which was a remarkable speed. The final workforce included over 5,000 construction workers. The town reached a peak population of 7,000, had the capacity to house over 10,000, and was planned to accommodate a possible population of 25,000. Amatol Plant\n\nLoading operations at the Amatol plant began on July 31, 1918, and on August 3, the first shell was loaded. The plant was capable of loading “60,000 shells of all sizes, 50,000 boosters, 50,000 hand grenades, and 20,000 rifle grenades per day, as well as components. To accomplish this work there were 15 smokeless-powder magazines, 33 T.N.T. magazines, 49 miscellaneous storage buildings, 642 plant structures in all.” The plant, during its operational lifespan, loaded over 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition of various types and sizes. Although T.N.T. was preferred and used when available, amatol was used as an alternative due to the shortage of T.N.T. Amatol was “the main charge pressed into the shell (unless straight T.N.T. or a 50/50 mix was used), [and] contains 80 percent of ammonium nitrate and 20 percent of T.N.T.”. The one disadvantage of amatol was that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of a shell loaded with amatol was uncertain after five years while the life of a shell loaded with T.N.T. was indefinite, certainly at least 25 years. The Army’s Ordnance Department took over the plant in February 1919 and denominated it Amatol Arsenal. By 1923, Amatol Arsenal ceased operations. Camp Amatol\n\nIn October 1918, 2,400 troops arrived at Amatol to assist in operations there. Their job was to bring the output to full loading capacity and they would even perform civilian tasks. In an October 14 article, many of these soldiers decided to take French leave—an unauthorized departure—by traveling to Atlantic City. A few of the soldiers were jailed when they were unable to show “leave of absence.” By the time of the armistice, there were 3,800 officers and enlisted men at Camp Amatol, as it became known. There were also Camp Amatol sports teams. Basketball was a big sport played amongst soldiers, including officers. A December 6, 1918 article records, “the Hammonton five defeated the U.S. Ordnance quintet from Camp Amatol by the score of 19 to 10.” A December 13, 1918 article describes how the U.S. Ordnance Officers team defeated the Amatol team in basketball by the score of 25 to 10. Conclusion\n\nIn just a matter of months after signing the Armistice, the population of Amatol had virtually vanished, with only a few hundred remaining there. The former munitions complex experienced a brief resurgence in 1926 after an investor backed the construction of the Atlantic City Speedway there. The revival was short-lived as interest quickly waned among the visiting public and other investors. Little remains of Amatol today. After a hike through the Pine Barrens, remnants of the munitions plant, town, and racetrack can be found at the former site of Amatol. Of the many buildings and homes that were constructed, only two still remain: the now-abandoned State Police barracks outside of Hammonton and one house, which was moved to the White Horse Pike, where it is still occupied. During the 1980s, the Amatol site was considered for a landfill, but the proposal was shot down due to environmental concerns and an opposition by local residents. Recently, in 2017, more than 500 acres of Amatol (now the Pine Barrens) were preserved. Amatol was not the only planned community that South Jersey saw built during World War I. Belcoville, Atlantic County, was also built as a munitions plant and village. Yorkship Village (now Fairview), Camden County, was built to house shipyard workers and their families. In addition, America also saw many new military bases built, which included Camp Dix (now Fort Dix), Burlington County. What was the overall impact of Amatol on the surrounding area?",
        "There is no reliable and readily-available information to answer this question. Where did the residents of Amatol go once operations ceased? According to the Press of Atlantic City, “Many of Amatol’s laborers, predominantly Irish and Polish from Philadelphia, stayed in the area and started families.” \n\nAs the centennial of America’s participation in the First World War draws to a close, it is good to take a moment to remember a little town, built in a forest in New Jersey, which helped with the war effort, and provided employment for thousands of American workers. ",
        "All Aboard for Amatol, NJ\n\nAs a result of America’s entry into World War I, Atlantic County received a great expansion of its industrial economic base. The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed. In just nine months’ time, the new town and manufactory were completed reaching a population of 7,000. Today, the Pine Barrens have all but reclaimed the former site of Amatol. History\n\nThe history of Amatol begins in December 1917 with the incorporation of the Atlantic Loading Company. Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected. In addition, there were also concerns over the safety of soldiers at Camp Dix due to possible accidents. In testimony given regarding Amatol, Lieutenant Colonel R.H. Hawkins stated that Camp Dix was not selected “because the commanding officer of Camp Dix told us he did not want it near his soldiers.” \n\nOther sites were considered, including Toms River, Lakehurst, Lacey, and Hammonton. Ultimately, Hammonton was selected. Although no definite source can be cited as to why Hammonton was selected over the other three sites, major reasons did include the potential quality of town life and the design of a safety zone. Additional testimony by Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins reveals this consideration: “We had to build rather attractive accommodations at Amatol. We had to make it just as attractive as we could in order to get people to stay there; particularly in view of the knowledge of most people of the danger.” Being situated between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, Amatol was conveniently located for ease of access to the Jersey Shore and a great metropolitan city. In addition to town amenities, Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins also explained that the size of Amatol—6,000 acres—was meant as a “substantial safety zone.” \n\nConstruction and Development\n\nAfter the final determination of the site had been made, the Atlantic Loading Company immediately went to work, which caught neighboring towns by surprise. The Tuckerton Beacon reported that on March 2, 1918, the residents of Elwood and Hammonton went to bed with a quiet night as it had been any other. To their surprise, they awoke to see a large force of strangers in their midst, a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend “Ordnance Department U.S.A.,” and heavy motor trucks noisily chugging in the streets. The next day, March 4, construction began.",
        "It is the intention of this project to give new life to this wonderful document. Amatol Comes to Life\n\nThe United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance. In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen  incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine. The effect on local residents is best described in an article from a local newspaper of the time. The March 9, 1918 issue of the South Jersey Republican gives this account of the activity at the site:  \"Never in history was Hammonton so stirred up as on Sunday and Monday, when announcement was made that the Government had taken land four miles below here and proposed employing twenty thousand hands to erect buildings and load shells for war purposes. The papers were signed Saturday noon, and Sunday nearly a half hundred army trucks, loaded with tools, lumber and supplies, passed through town to the scene, at East Hammonton, this side of Elwood.\"\n\nConstruction\n\nConstruction on the plant began March 4, 1918. Two miles away from the plant site , the town that would house the workers, was also constructed. This distance would ensure the safety of the residents from any accidental explosions at the munition plant. This circumstance was dramatically demonstrated in the terrible accident at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lake Denmark, New Jersey in 1926. Both Amatol and Town-site were complete within nine months time. The plant was designed for safety and redundancy. The plant was laid out so that an explosion in one building should not damage any other buildings. This was accomplished by designing the buildings in such a way that an explosion would move upward rather than outward. Additional protection, in some cases, was provided with soil filled barricades. Hazardous operations were carried out in duplicate buildings so that if one were destroyed in an explosion the entire operation would not be jeopardized. The Plant\n\nAmatol was designed to load a whole series of shells. These ranged from 75 mm projectiles to hand grenades. The steel components were brought in by rail and distributed to a series of facilities designated to the loading of specific ordnance. In the book there is a photographic description of each one of these plants. There are also plans for the various buildings and for each plant which indicate the rail and conveyor connections among the buildings of the plant. These are the 75-mm plant, 4.7 inch plant, 6 inch plants, 8 inch plant, hand grenade plant, booster plant, and rifle grenade plant. Amatol was a great example of the newly emerging discipline of industrial organization. Though no direct attribution in given in the book to specific theorists of efficient industrial production a great emphasis is placed on the \"perfect organization, methods and equipment\" required to achieve the record production accomplished at Amatol. Plant Operation\n\nThe operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. :  \" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion...While the pressure of war needs was on it was necessary to load amatol rather than straight T.N.T.... The mix has as high explosive power as T.N.T., the one disadvantage of using it being that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of the shell loaded with straight T.N.T. is indefinite--certainly 25 years--while the condition of shell loaded with amatol would be uncertain after perhaps five years.\"\n\nPlant Safety\n\n\"In the matter of protection, the plant has been covered in many respects beyond the usual means of care to lessen risk. The operating buildings are practically all steel-frame with composite lath and cement construction or corrugated metal sides.",
        "AMATOL ARSENAL. The principal operations of the production department consisted of unpacking, boostering, and repacking 75-millimeter shells which had been loaded during the war period; loading MK III 75-millimeter shells; loading, assembling, and packing MK IV 75-millimeter shells; loading MK IIA fragmentation drop bombs; loading 3-inch AA high-explosive shells MK I; loading drop bombs and boosters of various caliber, together with a varied assortment of experimental loading orders for drop bombs, antiaircraft ammunition, and shells running from 75 millimeters to 14 inches. The production operations were conducted at a low cost. The unpacking, boostering, and re-\n\npacking of 75-millimeter shell, for instance, was completed at a labor cost of 6 cents per shell, whereas contractors during the war period were paid from 17 to 21 cents. The maintenance department, in addition to urgent repair work on many of the approximately 1,000 buildings in the arsenal, scraped and repainted the corrugated iron roofs of 191 buildings in the plant and storage area and placed gutters and spouts on 167 of these buildings. The railroad transportation division handled 361 incoming and 698 outgoing loaded cars and made 5,819 intrayard car movements. The machinery storage division received 161 carloads of shell-loading machinery and equipment from ordnance establishments being abandoned. This machinery was painted and greased and placed in permanent storage. At the beginning of the fiscal year the motor transportation consisted of 2 busses, 2 ambulances, 36 touring cars, 38 trucks, and 7 motor cycles. By the close of the fiscal year this equipment had been reduced to 1 ambulance, 6 touring cars, and 6 trucks. The personnel was reduced from 13 chauffeurs and 6 mechanics to 1 chauffeur and 2 mechanics. In December, 1919, authority was granted to take a complete new physical inventory of the entire arsenal as of December 31, 1919. Material which has been reported to the Salvage Board for disposition will aggregate 250 carloads. The number of employees at the beginning of the fiscal year was 659 and at the close 337. The population of the village of Amatol, built to house 5,000 employees, was reduced to 100. The sale of the village as a whole was recommended. The White Horse Turnpike, which runs along the arsenal property line for a distance of 2 miles, is being developed by the State of New Jersey as a concrete boulevard from Camden to Atlantic City, adding desirable motor transportation facilities to the arsenal’s excellent rail connections. The value of the real estate, buildings, equipment, and material in storage is estimated to be approximately $62,000,000. This arsenal was commanded by Lieut.",
        "THE TOWN OF AMATOL\n\nThe town of Amatol, which is named after one of the explosives used in the plant, covers a tract of about 350 acres lying to the northeast of the plant. A distance of upward of two miles separates the closest points between town and plant. The town is located on a natural eminence, a few miles distant from the famous New Jersey coast resorts and is within the territory that comes under the influence of the Gulf Stream. The wood growth is largely the pines that have given to this section its reputation for healthfulness; and in clearing the land for the town, most of these trees, together with oaks, have been left standing. The industrial section of the town was made a long, narrow block reaching well in toward the center, and in this was built one branch of the railroad, all of the warehouses, the material storage yards, garages, heating plant, laundry, wood working shop and similar commercial structures. The impression given by a first view of Amatol is that of a well-kept suburban settlement. The town was not thrown together merely to put roofs and walls around its working people at night, but was built to keep its population satisfied with its surroundings and living conditions and tuned for the rapid production for which the establishment was designed. The town was planned on a basis of a possible population of 25,000. The houses were designed for speedy construction, yet planned to resist weather—the quickest, most economical construction capable of affording comfort and protection. The first impressive view of Liberty Court as one enters the town through West J Street is the keynote of the complete scheme. In the planning of the town thought was given to its general attractiveness as well as to the quick housing of its people.",
        "AMATOL ARSENAL\n\nIn March, 1918, a contract was entered into between the Ordnance  \nDepartment and the Atlantic Loading Co., under which the com-  \npany, as department agent, acquired by lease a tract of 6,000 acres  \nin southern New Jersey and erected and equipped a loading plant  \ncapable of loading 51,000 shell and 100,000 grenades per day. The  \nplant was designed for loading 75-mm, 4.7-inch, 6-inch, 8-inch, and  \n9.2-inch shell and hand and rifle grenades and drop bombs. It has  \nmagazine and warehouse facilities for 8,850,000 pounds of ammonium  \nnitrate, 6,250,000 pounds of T. N. T., 4,500,000 pounds of smokeless  \npowder, and 1,400 carloads of completed rounds. Plant and storage  \nareas are inclosed by a wire fence, well lighted and with proper guard  \nstations. In addition to the plant proper there was built a model town,  \nAmatol, capable of housing 5,000 employees. The houses were all  \narranged and constructed. There are a church, a post office, two  \nschoolhouses, a commodious theater building, a Y. M.",
        "Amatol was established in 1918, as a shell loading plant by\nthe Atlantic Loading Company. The population in 1918 was\n7,000, but had decreased to a few hundred in 1920.",
        "\nAmatol: A  former World War I munitions factory,  located   in Mullica Township, NJ\n\nThe Book\n\nShell Loading at Amatol, N.J. (150 scanned pages) is a rare, oversize book that documented the building of a bomb making facility at the tail end of World War I. Amatol was an extensive and attractive \"company town\" to support the ordnance facility. That town of 10,000 disappeared very quickly. However, unlike so many New Jersey \"ghost towns\", this one was fully documented by the company that built it. For anyone familiar with the site Amatol, and later, the wood board Atlantic City Speedway occupied, it is a shock to learn that there had been a large ammunition plant and a supporting town on land that is now covered by mature forest. The only remaining building on the site is the former barracks for the New Jersey State Police located on the White Horse Pike. The people who developed the facility, the factories and storage plants and the town itself comes to life through beautiful photographs in the book and on post-cards capturing a forgotten time. Even though it was a well-produced book, the enthusiasm of readers who have discovered the book has taken their toll on the book."

      "question": "How did the co-ordination of labor and machinery for efficient production contribute to the construction and operation of the shell loading plant during WW1?",
      "response": "The coordination of labor and machinery was crucial for ensuring the efficient construction and operation of the shell loading plant during WW1. This was achieved through meticulous organization, standardization, and the use of innovative methods and equipment. For example, the plant utilized assembly-line principles, with conveyor systems carrying shells through various stages of processing in a continuous and streamlined manner. The layout of the plant included separate buildings for different operations, such as shell reception, loading, and packing, connected by conveyor lines and rail transport, which minimized handling time and enhanced safety.\n\nFurthermore, the plant employed prefabricated steel structures and modular units, allowing rapid erection and flexibility for future modifications or conversions. The use of standardized components, like bolted steel units, sped up construction, while redundant and duplicate buildings for hazardous operations increased safety and ensured uninterrupted production even if one building was compromised. The integration of machinery—such as belt conveyors, melting kettles with safety features, and continuous processing lines—optimized production flow, significantly reducing time and labor costs.\n\nThis tight coordination of skilled labor, advanced machinery, and organized layout enabled the plant to rapidly transform a difficult site into a high-capacity ammunition factory and town in record time. It exemplifies how strategic planning in labor and machinery, emphasizing speed, safety, and standardization, contributed directly to the plant's successful and efficient operation during wartime.",

        "At the beginning of March, 1918, the site of the plant was an unbroken tract, mostly wooded, with some acres of swamp. The land was of a kind peculiarly difficult to clear for building construction, owing to the dense, tangled nature of the growth. Nine months later it was covered with a plant which has turned out ammunition of many types in large quantities, including drop bombs and large shell; and in addition a town capable of properly housing over 10,000 people, with the many needed buildings for administration, auxiliary operation, recreation, etc., has been built. At the outset it was necessary to obtain carpenters and other workmen, lumber, commissary outfits and supplies. Within the first week the first bunkhouse and mess hall were up, housing and feeding an initial force of forty men. From the beginning the work expanded with ever-increasing rapidity, buildings going up almost over night. The speed in construction may be gauged by the fact that, during a period of nine months, the Company constructed an average of about four buildings of various kinds a day, from construction office up to such large structures as loading, administration, mess and dormitory buildings. Besides the building construction for plant and town there was a great amount of auxiliary construction, consisting in part of about fifty miles of standard gauge railroad track, water supply, sewerage systems, thirty miles of 66,000-volt transmission line and other power systems, telephone and telegraph systems, centralized heating plants and electric-lighting stations. It was because that the rapidity with which the plant was placed under way was in a large measure fundamental to the fact that the living conditions and the town were fundamentally correct. “Speed—simplicity—results” were the watchwords in the construction of plant and town, but nevertheless all structures were substantially built. Semi-fire-proof construction of stucco and “Composite” metal unit was determined upon; and it is an interesting fact that this durable type of building was successfully used at almost the same cost as ordinary cantonment construction—very little in excess of the cost of wood and, in many cases, cheaper. The use of fabricated steel structures, assembled in panels at the factory, facilitated erection and aided in the “record” completion of the 75 mm plant. Standardized unit “A” frame steel structures were also used. An inspection of the accompanying photographs will indicate the elasticity of this standardized construction. The units being bolted together, the structure can be wrecked and readily converted into a large variety of manufacturing buildings. This steel construction was adopted because of the salvage value of the material. The fact that stands out most sharply in connection with this vast enterprise is that while the Company has built substantially, it has also built quickly. Precisely what this has meant in physical construction is shown by the concrete figures given in the following statistical table:\n\nThese statistics cover the development as planned. The signing of the armistice caused the suspension of construction work and also some result some work for which material was purchased and delivered was not completed. About 90 per cent. of the construction was finished and in addition the actual loading of shell had been carried on for several months. Loading operations began July 31, 1918. First shell loaded (75 m. m.",
        "SCOPE OF THE WORK\n\nIn April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers. The achievements of 1918 showed how well this work had been done in 1917. Once the lathes and the forges were working it became necessary to supply the high explosives with which to charge the shell they turned out, and to provide extensive machinery for doing the charging. Contracts were made for the production on a vast scale of trinitrotoluol, the destructive explosive used in modern big gun ammunition, and other contracts for the construction of plants for the loading of the shell as fast as the mills turned them out. Four large shell loading plants were projected and eventually placed in operation, namely, those of the Bethlehem Loading Co., the T. A. Gillespie Loading Co., the DuPont Engineering Co. and the Atlantic Loading Company. Of these the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company is the largest. It is located at Amatol, New Jersey—a town which came into being to house its workers, and is about 25 miles from Atlantic City, adjacent to and north of the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads. The site consists of a tract of approximately 6,000 acres of land, with its western boundary about six miles east of Hammonton, New Jersey. The history of the Atlantic Loading Company is a story of organization, construction and production in quick-step time. It entered into a contract with the Ordnance Department of the Government to act as its agent in loading and storing shell, and it conducted its work and enterprise from first to last in accordance with the rules and regulations of that department. It began the work of construction on its plant on March 4, 1918, began operations the following July, and in August loaded its first shell, and in the meantime it also had built the new town of Amatol. An indication of the high speed with which its operations were conducted may be found in the fact that within twenty-four hours after the site was finally determined upon, actual work on clearing the land for the plant was under way. The enterprise combined two separate and distinct undertakings, either of which in itself would require an organization embracing high skill, initiative and intensive working power. One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made ready to house the workers at the same time. It was in contemplation of this that the Atlantic Loading Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine in December, 1917. The stated purposes of the corporation were: first, to construct and operate a shell loading plant for the production of completed rounds of ammunition and to provide the necessary storage capacity therefor; second, to build a town for the housing of the operatives. The plant was designed to be the largest of its type in the country, providing for the loading of shell of all sizes from 75 mm, to 10-inch drop bombs, depth bombs, rifle grenades, hand grenades and boosters. The charter provisions were very broad, in order to permit the Company to enter into contracts for construction of any and all kinds, such as steam and electric railroads, manufacturing plants, electrical transmission lines, power developments, buildings and bridges. The Atlantic Loading Company is the tri-party control of O.",
        "The plant reached a production of 16,000 shell of this type in a day of eight hours. However, on account of Government requirements, this unit was compelled to load both 75 mm shell and aerial drop bombs. An index of the flexibility of the layout was the development of the extruding machine for loading drop bombs with Amatol in the 75 mm plant. The next unit to start operations was the booster plant; and following this, the 4.7-inch plant. One of the methods worked out by the organization that has resulted in greater safety in shell production is in the construction of the kettle in which trinitrotoluol is melted. Heretofore, the kettles were steam jacketed and should the pressure reducing valves fail the temperature of the T.N.T., or the 50/50 mix, would reach a dangerous point liable to cause explosion. In the construction used by the Atlantic Loading Company the kettles are water jacketed; that is, the steam pipes are surrounded with water between the inner and outer casings of the double kettle with a vent to the air. It is therefore impossible for the temperature of the mix to become higher than boiling water, and this is well below the danger point of high explosive temperature. The Company's engineers were the first to use belt conveyors in the production of shell. To turn out shell in large quantity and economically this operation must be one continuous process from the receiving room to the final stage. The conveyors carry the shell continuously from the first stage to the last with a resultant maximum economy of time and labor. No other plant has used the same system of loading as that worked out by the Atlantic Loading Company. The general plant layout shows the division of the operations in separate buildings in such a way that, should fire or explosion start in one building, the other buildings in which the same operations are done, may still continue at work. In all plants the more hazardous operations instead of being localized in a single structure are carried on in either two or three duplicate buildings. With the cross conveyor system, great elasticity in operation is obtainable in emergency. The buildings are separated from each other by a minimum distance of 200 feet.",
        "Quite unexpectedly the necessities of war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil was easily worked and there was available a subterranean supply of excellent water readily tapped by driving wells. The moderate, healthful and equable climate was also suitable for a large industrial community. Early in the year 1918 the Company acquired for the Government a tract of 6000 acres of this land lying near the town of Hammonton, New Jersey. The Company began work on March 4th, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, laid out and built a new town and an enormous plant, peopled the former with workmen and equipped the latter with machinery and begun the loading of shell. The transformation of the wilderness into a hive of industry within such a short time was one of the many war-time marvels of American engineering achievement. The history of the work is a story of the accomplishment of brain power, engineering talent and the genius of American business organization, which reflects the highest credit upon all concerned. The leaders in the formation of the Atlantic Loading Company were O.",
        "THE PLANT\nThe Atlantic Loading Company's plant was designed to load more than 25 percent of the entire amount of shell that the Ordnance Department had placed orders for loading, assembling, and packing. It is organized to produce shell of all types, it is believed, more rapidly and with greater economy than any other plant of its kind in the United States. The men associated in this project have produced all told over 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition of various types. Briefly, the operations of the plant consist of loading, assembling and packing fixed ammunition. The shell is loaded with trinitrotoluol (T.N.T.), or T.N.T. and ammonium nitrate, the cartridge cases are filled with smokeless powder and the booster, which finally detonates the main charge, is placed in the nose of the shell. To carry through these operations with the least possible danger and with the speed required by needs of war the most perfect organization, methods and equipment were required, and the record production of the plant is clear proof that this was fully accomplished. Loading Plant Data\n75 mm/m: 3 units\n\n4.7-inch: 1 unit\n\n155 mm/m: 50/50 (T.N.T. and ammonium nitrate): 2 units\n\n155 mm/m: 80/20 (80% ammonium nitrate, 20% T.N.T.): 3 units\n\n8-inch (and larger): 3 units\n\nBooster: 1 unit\n\nRifle grenade: 1 unit\n\nHand grenade: 1 unit\n\nTotal capacity: 60,000 shell (all sizes) and 125,000 small parts, such as boosters and grenades per day.

        "It is the intention of this project to give new life to this wonderful document. Amatol Comes to Life\n\nThe United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance. In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen  incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine. The effect on local residents is best described in an article from a local newspaper of the time. The March 9, 1918 issue of the South Jersey Republican gives this account of the activity at the site:  \"Never in history was Hammonton so stirred up as on Sunday and Monday, when announcement was made that the Government had taken land four miles below here and proposed employing twenty thousand hands to erect buildings and load shells for war purposes. The papers were signed Saturday noon, and Sunday nearly a half hundred army trucks, loaded with tools, lumber and supplies, passed through town to the scene, at East Hammonton, this side of Elwood.\"\n\nConstruction\n\nConstruction on the plant began March 4, 1918. Two miles away from the plant site , the town that would house the workers, was also constructed. This distance would ensure the safety of the residents from any accidental explosions at the munition plant. This circumstance was dramatically demonstrated in the terrible accident at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lake Denmark, New Jersey in 1926. Both Amatol and Town-site were complete within nine months time. The plant was designed for safety and redundancy. The plant was laid out so that an explosion in one building should not damage any other buildings. This was accomplished by designing the buildings in such a way that an explosion would move upward rather than outward. Additional protection, in some cases, was provided with soil filled barricades. Hazardous operations were carried out in duplicate buildings so that if one were destroyed in an explosion the entire operation would not be jeopardized. The Plant\n\nAmatol was designed to load a whole series of shells. These ranged from 75 mm projectiles to hand grenades. The steel components were brought in by rail and distributed to a series of facilities designated to the loading of specific ordnance. In the book there is a photographic description of each one of these plants. There are also plans for the various buildings and for each plant which indicate the rail and conveyor connections among the buildings of the plant. These are the 75-mm plant, 4.7 inch plant, 6 inch plants, 8 inch plant, hand grenade plant, booster plant, and rifle grenade plant. Amatol was a great example of the newly emerging discipline of industrial organization. Though no direct attribution in given in the book to specific theorists of efficient industrial production a great emphasis is placed on the \"perfect organization, methods and equipment\" required to achieve the record production accomplished at Amatol. Plant Operation\n\nThe operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. :  \" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion...While the pressure of war needs was on it was necessary to load amatol rather than straight T.N.T.... The mix has as high explosive power as T.N.T., the one disadvantage of using it being that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of the shell loaded with straight T.N.T. is indefinite--certainly 25 years--while the condition of shell loaded with amatol would be uncertain after perhaps five years.\"\n\nPlant Safety\n\n\"In the matter of protection, the plant has been covered in many respects beyond the usual means of care to lessen risk. The operating buildings are practically all steel-frame with composite lath and cement construction or corrugated metal sides.",
        "PLANT OPERATION\n\nIn mountainous countries where precious metal ores are milled or smelted at the mines the works are built if possible on the side of a hill, so that the ore enters at the top and descends by the aid of gravity until it reaches the last process at the bottom. A similar plan to minimize the handling of shell was devised by the Atlantic Loading Company and put into successful use at the Amatol works. Instead of the force of gravity, power belt conveyors are used, and these conveyors carry the shell from the receiving building through all successive processes until they are delivered, finished at the end of the unit for shipment. The conveyors are also great time savers and are one of the principal factors for speedy production. They consist of endless belts riding on fixed rollers in narrow tramways, laid on the floors or on the level of the working benches. The total length of the conveyor lines is 12 miles. Shell Journey on the Conveyor\nThe journey of a shell along the conveyor line in any of the units is an interesting demonstration of the time and labor-saving nature of the device. Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. At practically no time is it necessary to lift the shell at all, the workman rolling it along flat as he does his task to another workman, who does his particular job and either passes it along by rolling or rolls it back on the conveyor, which carries it to the next process. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion. Initial Shell Preparation\nIn the receiving building the shells are received, cleaned and shellaced. Empty shell storage space is here provided for 15 to 20 days' production. When received at the plant the shell have their copper or metal shipping gags screwed in the nose, and the first process is the removal of these plugs. This is a machine operation. The remover heads are placed at a revolving shaft, and the men engage the plug and unscrew it. Sequential Processing\nFrom the receiving building the shell are carried forward to each successive stage on conveyor lines, which finally converge in the packing and shipping building. Amatol, which is the main charge pressed into the shell (unless straight trinitrotoluol (T.N.T.) or a 50/50 mix is used) contains 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% T.N.T. Mixing Ammonium Nitrate and T.N.T. The ammonium nitrate is crushed and dried before mixing. The T.N.T. is melted and the two are mixed in the kettle room. The kettles have hot water jackets, heated by a steam coil within the jacket, and each kettle is provided with an agitator. The total charge of a kettle is about 800 pounds, and a melt is obtained every two hours. When a mixture is used the amount of T.N.T. needed is first melted in the kettle and then hot ammonium nitrate is added until a full charge of proper proportions is obtained. When T.N.T. is poured, the material is drawn off into stirring tubs. Stirring is necessary because of the rapid crystallization of T.N.T. when cooling begins, which might cause exudation in the charge.",
        "impossible to describe these in detail, but a few illustrations will give the reader a better idea of the difficulties which were met and surmounted. Construction naturally was the first thing on the programme. In all construction the two main factors are labor and materials. Even in normal times these factors are difficult problems in any large undertaking. In the early part of the year 1918, with the whole country absorbed in war work and with normal conditions completely upset, they presented ten-fold more difficulties. To get labor with which to build its plant and town the Company was compelled to go into a labor market booming from unprecedented demand and to bid against high wages in all industries. But the problem was solved by making the work attractive and providing the best living and housing conditions for the workers.",
        "GRAHAM. Well, was that under some order of the Secretary of War, or somebody, that that was done? COL. HAWKINS. In November, I think it was, of 1917, Gen. Crozier submitted this to the General Staff, and my recollection is that the Secretary of War approved it, but did not approve it in writing. Later on, we got his written approval, in the latter part of 1918. MR. GRAHAM. From the Secretary of War? COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir. MR. GRAHAM. Was it after the armistice? COL. HAWKINS. No, sir; it was in September of 1918, I should think. But our original submission of the whole scheme was made in November of 1917, and the contracts were let to most of these companies on the 3rd of December, 1917, and the first one in operation that I recollect was the Gillespie Co. loading plant at Morgan, N.J., and the second one in operation was the Atlantic Loading Co. plant and the third the California loading plant; I am unable to state when the Penneman plant got into operation. MR. GRAHAM. Now, let us see about this loading plant. In times of peace is there any purpose for any such plant? COL.",
        "ORGANIZATION\n\"With any large undertaking the keynote to success is organization,\" and the efficiency of an organization depends upon the correct division of the work in hand among several departments and the proper co-ordination of those departments one with another. In the Amatol project organization was particularly vital because of the rapidity with which the work had to be done and of the many new problems presented. The very nature of the work required an organization of experts. These were drafted from going concerns engaged in large construction and financial enterprises. Loading shell with high explosives is a hazardous undertaking, and the men who formed the Atlantic Loading Company realized this. They summoned to their aid only men of broad experience along similar lines who had proven their fitness in successful work elsewhere."

        "\nLOCATE WAR PLANT AT TOMS RIVER \n\nAtlantic Loading Co. Will Make Shells at New Factory To Employ 20,000 Men. Residents of Ocean County are very much interested over the announcement that the Atlantic Loading company of New York has practically decided to locate the big loading plant at this place. There has been a good deal of uncertainty for the past two weeks as to where the plant would be located, four sites having been under consideration: the Davenport tract here, the Bidwell-Stone property at Lakehurst, the Cedar Crest site, and a site at Hammonton. Engineers of the War Department have been here for more than two weeks plotting and testing out the ground, and while no exact statement has been made as to the selection, an automobile load of blueprints for the buildings arrived from New York last night, followed by 10 engineers and contractors today. Officials of the War Department and of the Atlantic Loading Company have been in consultation all day with George W. Holman, president of the Ocean County Trust Company, William M. Blecher, editor of the Toms River Courier, and George O. Van Ness, president of the County Tax Board, who have been the leaders in the fight to get the plant located here, and they’ve practically assured them the site here will be selected. The plant will load shells for the government, and not manufacture ammunition, as was at first stated. The proposed site is along the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, having a railroad frontage of more than five miles, and will consist of some 900 acres. Options on all the land have been secured and are in the hands of the engineers while the titles are being searched at the county clerk’s office. It has been stated that the plant will open with 400 men and will increase until 20,000 are employed. It had been the original intention of the company to locate at Hanover Farms, 10 miles west of this place, and work was begun, when it was discovered that the water used at the plant came from the same stream that supplies Camp Dix, and the work was stopped on orders from the War Department. Immediately the board of trade put the matter in the hands of Mr. Holman, Mr. Blecher, and Mr. Van Ness, who secured options on this tract with the result so far achieved. The site under consideration is located on what is locally known as the Chemical Company property and the Davenport section. The Chemical property was owned and operated by the Davis Chemical Company for a number of years and was later recarried into the bankruptcy courts by the creditors of the company.

        "Quite unexpectedly the necessities of war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil was easily worked and there was available a subterranean supply of excellent water readily tapped by driving wells. The moderate, healthful and equable climate was also suitable for a large industrial community. Early in the year 1918 the Company acquired for the Government a tract of 6000 acres of this land lying near the town of Hammonton, New Jersey. The Company began work on March 4th, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, laid out and built a new town and an enormous plant, peopled the former with workmen and equipped the latter with machinery and begun the loading of shell. The transformation of the wilderness into a hive of industry within such a short time was one of the many war-time marvels of American engineering achievement. The history of the work is a story of the accomplishment of brain power, engineering talent and the genius of American business organization, which reflects the highest credit upon all concerned. The leaders in the formation of the Atlantic Loading Company were O.",
        "THE TOWN OF AMATOL\n\nThe town of Amatol, which is named after one of the explosives used in the plant, covers a tract of about 350 acres lying to the northeast of the plant. A distance of upward of two miles separates the closest points between town and plant. The town is located on a natural eminence, a few miles distant from the famous New Jersey coast resorts and is within the territory that comes under the influence of the Gulf Stream. The wood growth is largely the pines that have given to this section its reputation for healthfulness; and in clearing the land for the town, most of these trees, together with oaks, have been left standing. The industrial section of the town was made a long, narrow block reaching well in toward the center, and in this was built one branch of the railroad, all of the warehouses, the material storage yards, garages, heating plant, laundry, wood working shop and similar commercial structures. The impression given by a first view of Amatol is that of a well-kept suburban settlement. The town was not thrown together merely to put roofs and walls around its working people at night, but was built to keep its population satisfied with its surroundings and living conditions and tuned for the rapid production for which the establishment was designed. The town was planned on a basis of a possible population of 25,000. The houses were designed for speedy construction, yet planned to resist weather—the quickest, most economical construction capable of affording comfort and protection. The first impressive view of Liberty Court as one enters the town through West J Street is the keynote of the complete scheme. In the planning of the town thought was given to its general attractiveness as well as to the quick housing of its people.",
        "It is the intention of this project to give new life to this wonderful document. Amatol Comes to Life\n\nThe United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance. In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen  incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine. The effect on local residents is best described in an article from a local newspaper of the time. The March 9, 1918 issue of the South Jersey Republican gives this account of the activity at the site:  \"Never in history was Hammonton so stirred up as on Sunday and Monday, when announcement was made that the Government had taken land four miles below here and proposed employing twenty thousand hands to erect buildings and load shells for war purposes. The papers were signed Saturday noon, and Sunday nearly a half hundred army trucks, loaded with tools, lumber and supplies, passed through town to the scene, at East Hammonton, this side of Elwood.\"\n\nConstruction\n\nConstruction on the plant began March 4, 1918. Two miles away from the plant site , the town that would house the workers, was also constructed. This distance would ensure the safety of the residents from any accidental explosions at the munition plant. This circumstance was dramatically demonstrated in the terrible accident at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lake Denmark, New Jersey in 1926. Both Amatol and Town-site were complete within nine months time. The plant was designed for safety and redundancy. The plant was laid out so that an explosion in one building should not damage any other buildings. This was accomplished by designing the buildings in such a way that an explosion would move upward rather than outward. Additional protection, in some cases, was provided with soil filled barricades. Hazardous operations were carried out in duplicate buildings so that if one were destroyed in an explosion the entire operation would not be jeopardized. The Plant\n\nAmatol was designed to load a whole series of shells. These ranged from 75 mm projectiles to hand grenades. The steel components were brought in by rail and distributed to a series of facilities designated to the loading of specific ordnance. In the book there is a photographic description of each one of these plants. There are also plans for the various buildings and for each plant which indicate the rail and conveyor connections among the buildings of the plant. These are the 75-mm plant, 4.7 inch plant, 6 inch plants, 8 inch plant, hand grenade plant, booster plant, and rifle grenade plant. Amatol was a great example of the newly emerging discipline of industrial organization. Though no direct attribution in given in the book to specific theorists of efficient industrial production a great emphasis is placed on the \"perfect organization, methods and equipment\" required to achieve the record production accomplished at Amatol. Plant Operation\n\nThe operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. :  \" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion...While the pressure of war needs was on it was necessary to load amatol rather than straight T.N.T.... The mix has as high explosive power as T.N.T., the one disadvantage of using it being that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of the shell loaded with straight T.N.T. is indefinite--certainly 25 years--while the condition of shell loaded with amatol would be uncertain after perhaps five years.\"\n\nPlant Safety\n\n\"In the matter of protection, the plant has been covered in many respects beyond the usual means of care to lessen risk. The operating buildings are practically all steel-frame with composite lath and cement construction or corrugated metal sides.",
        "SCOPE OF THE WORK\n\nIn April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers. The achievements of 1918 showed how well this work had been done in 1917. Once the lathes and the forges were working it became necessary to supply the high explosives with which to charge the shell they turned out, and to provide extensive machinery for doing the charging. Contracts were made for the production on a vast scale of trinitrotoluol, the destructive explosive used in modern big gun ammunition, and other contracts for the construction of plants for the loading of the shell as fast as the mills turned them out. Four large shell loading plants were projected and eventually placed in operation, namely, those of the Bethlehem Loading Co., the T. A. Gillespie Loading Co., the DuPont Engineering Co. and the Atlantic Loading Company. Of these the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company is the largest. It is located at Amatol, New Jersey—a town which came into being to house its workers, and is about 25 miles from Atlantic City, adjacent to and north of the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads. The site consists of a tract of approximately 6,000 acres of land, with its western boundary about six miles east of Hammonton, New Jersey. The history of the Atlantic Loading Company is a story of organization, construction and production in quick-step time. It entered into a contract with the Ordnance Department of the Government to act as its agent in loading and storing shell, and it conducted its work and enterprise from first to last in accordance with the rules and regulations of that department. It began the work of construction on its plant on March 4, 1918, began operations the following July, and in August loaded its first shell, and in the meantime it also had built the new town of Amatol. An indication of the high speed with which its operations were conducted may be found in the fact that within twenty-four hours after the site was finally determined upon, actual work on clearing the land for the plant was under way. The enterprise combined two separate and distinct undertakings, either of which in itself would require an organization embracing high skill, initiative and intensive working power. One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made ready to house the workers at the same time. It was in contemplation of this that the Atlantic Loading Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine in December, 1917. The stated purposes of the corporation were: first, to construct and operate a shell loading plant for the production of completed rounds of ammunition and to provide the necessary storage capacity therefor; second, to build a town for the housing of the operatives. The plant was designed to be the largest of its type in the country, providing for the loading of shell of all sizes from 75 mm, to 10-inch drop bombs, depth bombs, rifle grenades, hand grenades and boosters. The charter provisions were very broad, in order to permit the Company to enter into contracts for construction of any and all kinds, such as steam and electric railroads, manufacturing plants, electrical transmission lines, power developments, buildings and bridges. The Atlantic Loading Company is the tri-party control of O.",
        "PLANT OPERATION\n\nIn mountainous countries where precious metal ores are milled or smelted at the mines the works are built if possible on the side of a hill, so that the ore enters at the top and descends by the aid of gravity until it reaches the last process at the bottom. A similar plan to minimize the handling of shell was devised by the Atlantic Loading Company and put into successful use at the Amatol works. Instead of the force of gravity, power belt conveyors are used, and these conveyors carry the shell from the receiving building through all successive processes until they are delivered, finished at the end of the unit for shipment. The conveyors are also great time savers and are one of the principal factors for speedy production. They consist of endless belts riding on fixed rollers in narrow tramways, laid on the floors or on the level of the working benches. The total length of the conveyor lines is 12 miles. Shell Journey on the Conveyor\nThe journey of a shell along the conveyor line in any of the units is an interesting demonstration of the time and labor-saving nature of the device. Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. At practically no time is it necessary to lift the shell at all, the workman rolling it along flat as he does his task to another workman, who does his particular job and either passes it along by rolling or rolls it back on the conveyor, which carries it to the next process. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion. Initial Shell Preparation\nIn the receiving building the shells are received, cleaned and shellaced. Empty shell storage space is here provided for 15 to 20 days' production. When received at the plant the shell have their copper or metal shipping gags screwed in the nose, and the first process is the removal of these plugs. This is a machine operation. The remover heads are placed at a revolving shaft, and the men engage the plug and unscrew it. Sequential Processing\nFrom the receiving building the shell are carried forward to each successive stage on conveyor lines, which finally converge in the packing and shipping building. Amatol, which is the main charge pressed into the shell (unless straight trinitrotoluol (T.N.T.) or a 50/50 mix is used) contains 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% T.N.T. Mixing Ammonium Nitrate and T.N.T. The ammonium nitrate is crushed and dried before mixing. The T.N.T. is melted and the two are mixed in the kettle room. The kettles have hot water jackets, heated by a steam coil within the jacket, and each kettle is provided with an agitator. The total charge of a kettle is about 800 pounds, and a melt is obtained every two hours. When a mixture is used the amount of T.N.T. needed is first melted in the kettle and then hot ammonium nitrate is added until a full charge of proper proportions is obtained. When T.N.T. is poured, the material is drawn off into stirring tubs. Stirring is necessary because of the rapid crystallization of T.N.T. when cooling begins, which might cause exudation in the charge.",
        "Both are under direct government supervision, but each will be conducted separately, under the management of the above firms. The two big plants will be almost identical in size, equipment and method of operation and their effect on the surrounding county will be farreaching. Like the plant of the Bethlehem concern at this place, the Atlantic plant will be a \"war plant\" and subject to war conditions, but in the case of each it is doubtful that such heavy investment in buildings, machinery, living quarters, railroads, and other equipment will be abandoned after the war demand ceases and permanent industry will result. Mays Landing is beginning to feel the effects of construction work on the big loading plant here, which is well under way and will be a hive of industry in a short time.",
        "AMATOL ARSENAL\n\nIn March, 1918, a contract was entered into between the Ordnance  \nDepartment and the Atlantic Loading Co., under which the com-  \npany, as department agent, acquired by lease a tract of 6,000 acres  \nin southern New Jersey and erected and equipped a loading plant  \ncapable of loading 51,000 shell and 100,000 grenades per day. The  \nplant was designed for loading 75-mm, 4.7-inch, 6-inch, 8-inch, and  \n9.2-inch shell and hand and rifle grenades and drop bombs. It has  \nmagazine and warehouse facilities for 8,850,000 pounds of ammonium  \nnitrate, 6,250,000 pounds of T. N. T., 4,500,000 pounds of smokeless  \npowder, and 1,400 carloads of completed rounds. Plant and storage  \nareas are inclosed by a wire fence, well lighted and with proper guard  \nstations. In addition to the plant proper there was built a model town,  \nAmatol, capable of housing 5,000 employees. The houses were all  \narranged and constructed. There are a church, a post office, two  \nschoolhouses, a commodious theater building, a Y. M."

      "question": "How did the development and subsequent disappearance of the Amatol munitions factory in New Jersey reflect the United States' wartime efforts during World War I, and what lasting impacts did this have on the local community and historical documentation?",
      "response": "The development and subsequent disappearance of the Amatol munitions factory in New Jersey vividly reflect the United States' wartime efforts during World War I. During the war, there was an urgent need to produce vast quantities of munitions to support Allied forces. Amatol was constructed rapidly—within nine months—to meet this demand, serving as a major shell-loading plant capable of producing millions of rounds. The factory town built to support this effort was an exemplary planned community, equipped with modern amenities, housing over 10,000 workers and their families, and functioning as a vital logistical hub. Its construction represented the mobilization of American industrial capacity, technological innovation, and organization to support the war effort.\n\nHowever, with the end of World War I and the signing of the armistice in November 1918, the urgency for such massive munitions production evaporated. Consequently, the Amatol plant was swiftly closed by 1919, and the town was abandoned just as quickly as it was built. This rapid deconstruction underscores how the community was essentially a wartime construct, designed solely for the duration of the conflict.\n\nThe lasting impacts on the local community included the departure of many of its laborers, who mostly stayed in the region and started families, contributing to local population and economic stabilization in some cases. Yet, physically, little remains of Amatol today—only a few remnants like the abandoned State Police barracks and a relocated house—highlighting how ephemeral wartime-driven communities can be.\n\nIn terms of historical documentation, Amatol's story has been well-preserved through photographs, detailed books, and postcards. These records provide a rare and comprehensive glimpse into the scale of wartime industrial mobilization and urban planning. They serve as enduring testaments to America's capacity for rapid industrial development during wartime, even if the communities themselves were transient and largely erased by time and nature. \n\nOverall, Amatol exemplifies how wartime efforts can catalyze rapid urbanization and industrial growth, leaving a legacy of technological achievement and community planning, which is often short-lived but historically significant.",

        "By June, the population was nearly 2,000, and train service was added. By August, advertisements for Amatol described it as “a city with all modern improvements with electric lights, a fire department, a police department, a modern sewage system, a modern water plant, a theatre, a Y.M.C.A, an auditorium, bowling alleys, and other city amenities.” Amatol also promised many employment opportunities, not just with the munitions plant, but with local businesses, like barbers, tailors, jewelers, watchmakers, and grocers. By the signing of the armistice, plant and town structures included: 122 loading buildings, 159 storage buildings and magazines, 4 administration buildings, 6 office buildings, 22 industrial buildings, 7 hospitals, 16 recreation centers, 1 theatre, 18 mess halls, 4 garages, 15 warehouses, 21 railroad structures, 12 stables, 130 guardhouses, sentry boxes, searchlights, etc., 21 commercial stores, 98 male dormitories and bunkhouses, 21 female dormitories, 140 miscellaneous buildings, 24 Army barracks, 4 Y.M.C.A.’s, 11 individual residences, 33 multiple houses, 227 workmen’s houses, 1 post office, 1 school house, 2 fire houses, 444 tent tops, 96 two-roomed family apartments, 179 four-roomed family apartments, 23 three-roomed family apartments. On average, there were four buildings built per day, which was a remarkable speed. The final workforce included over 5,000 construction workers. The town reached a peak population of 7,000, had the capacity to house over 10,000, and was planned to accommodate a possible population of 25,000. Amatol Plant\n\nLoading operations at the Amatol plant began on July 31, 1918, and on August 3, the first shell was loaded. The plant was capable of loading “60,000 shells of all sizes, 50,000 boosters, 50,000 hand grenades, and 20,000 rifle grenades per day, as well as components. To accomplish this work there were 15 smokeless-powder magazines, 33 T.N.T. magazines, 49 miscellaneous storage buildings, 642 plant structures in all.” The plant, during its operational lifespan, loaded over 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition of various types and sizes. Although T.N.T. was preferred and used when available, amatol was used as an alternative due to the shortage of T.N.T. Amatol was “the main charge pressed into the shell (unless straight T.N.T. or a 50/50 mix was used), [and] contains 80 percent of ammonium nitrate and 20 percent of T.N.T.”. The one disadvantage of amatol was that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of a shell loaded with amatol was uncertain after five years while the life of a shell loaded with T.N.T. was indefinite, certainly at least 25 years. The Army’s Ordnance Department took over the plant in February 1919 and denominated it Amatol Arsenal. By 1923, Amatol Arsenal ceased operations. Camp Amatol\n\nIn October 1918, 2,400 troops arrived at Amatol to assist in operations there. Their job was to bring the output to full loading capacity and they would even perform civilian tasks. In an October 14 article, many of these soldiers decided to take French leave—an unauthorized departure—by traveling to Atlantic City. A few of the soldiers were jailed when they were unable to show “leave of absence.” By the time of the armistice, there were 3,800 officers and enlisted men at Camp Amatol, as it became known. There were also Camp Amatol sports teams. Basketball was a big sport played amongst soldiers, including officers. A December 6, 1918 article records, “the Hammonton five defeated the U.S. Ordnance quintet from Camp Amatol by the score of 19 to 10.” A December 13, 1918 article describes how the U.S. Ordnance Officers team defeated the Amatol team in basketball by the score of 25 to 10. Conclusion\n\nIn just a matter of months after signing the Armistice, the population of Amatol had virtually vanished, with only a few hundred remaining there. The former munitions complex experienced a brief resurgence in 1926 after an investor backed the construction of the Atlantic City Speedway there. The revival was short-lived as interest quickly waned among the visiting public and other investors. Little remains of Amatol today. After a hike through the Pine Barrens, remnants of the munitions plant, town, and racetrack can be found at the former site of Amatol. Of the many buildings and homes that were constructed, only two still remain: the now-abandoned State Police barracks outside of Hammonton and one house, which was moved to the White Horse Pike, where it is still occupied. During the 1980s, the Amatol site was considered for a landfill, but the proposal was shot down due to environmental concerns and an opposition by local residents. Recently, in 2017, more than 500 acres of Amatol (now the Pine Barrens) were preserved. Amatol was not the only planned community that South Jersey saw built during World War I. Belcoville, Atlantic County, was also built as a munitions plant and village. Yorkship Village (now Fairview), Camden County, was built to house shipyard workers and their families. In addition, America also saw many new military bases built, which included Camp Dix (now Fort Dix), Burlington County. What was the overall impact of Amatol on the surrounding area?",
        "\nAmatol: A  former World War I munitions factory,  located   in Mullica Township, NJ\n\nThe Book\n\nShell Loading at Amatol, N.J. (150 scanned pages) is a rare, oversize book that documented the building of a bomb making facility at the tail end of World War I. Amatol was an extensive and attractive \"company town\" to support the ordnance facility. That town of 10,000 disappeared very quickly. However, unlike so many New Jersey \"ghost towns\", this one was fully documented by the company that built it. For anyone familiar with the site Amatol, and later, the wood board Atlantic City Speedway occupied, it is a shock to learn that there had been a large ammunition plant and a supporting town on land that is now covered by mature forest. The only remaining building on the site is the former barracks for the New Jersey State Police located on the White Horse Pike. The people who developed the facility, the factories and storage plants and the town itself comes to life through beautiful photographs in the book and on post-cards capturing a forgotten time. Even though it was a well-produced book, the enthusiasm of readers who have discovered the book has taken their toll on the book.",
        "Today, if you look closely, you can still see parts of Amatol... During World War I, a new explosive was invented by the British so that they could stretch their depleting supplies of TNT. This explosive was a mixture of TNT and another high explosive, and it was called Amatol. In 1917, the US entered the War. Then, in 1918, the US built a plant to supply munitions to the armed forces. It purchased 6000 acres of land a few miles east of Hammonton, NJ, and built a munitions plant and a town to house the 10,000-20,000 plant workers. The plant made munitions of many different types and sizes, and was called Amatol. The town of Amatol was built two miles away. This distance was to protect the workers and families in the event of an accident at the plant. This town was planned out well and was built quickly. It included a residential section consisting of houses, dormitories, bunk houses, schools and churches. The industrial section had water, electric and sewage plants. There was a bowling alley, swimming pool, YMCA, tennis courts, and a movie theater for entertainment. The Amatol Railroad was built to transport workers between the plant and town. When the war ended, the plant closed down and the town was deserted.",
        "There is no reliable and readily-available information to answer this question. Where did the residents of Amatol go once operations ceased? According to the Press of Atlantic City, “Many of Amatol’s laborers, predominantly Irish and Polish from Philadelphia, stayed in the area and started families.” \n\nAs the centennial of America’s participation in the First World War draws to a close, it is good to take a moment to remember a little town, built in a forest in New Jersey, which helped with the war effort, and provided employment for thousands of American workers.

Amatol, New Jersey, was built on 6,000 acres of land in the Pine Barrens. The planned community was short lived: After World War I ended that same year, Amatol became a vacant town. The homes were deserted and the plant shut down.",
        "All Aboard for Amatol, NJ\n\nAs a result of America’s entry into World War I, Atlantic County received a great expansion of its industrial economic base. The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed. In just nine months’ time, the new town and manufactory were completed reaching a population of 7,000. Today, the Pine Barrens have all but reclaimed the former site of Amatol. History\n\nThe history of Amatol begins in December 1917 with the incorporation of the Atlantic Loading Company. Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected. In addition, there were also concerns over the safety of soldiers at Camp Dix due to possible accidents. In testimony given regarding Amatol, Lieutenant Colonel R.H. Hawkins stated that Camp Dix was not selected “because the commanding officer of Camp Dix told us he did not want it near his soldiers.” \n\nOther sites were considered, including Toms River, Lakehurst, Lacey, and Hammonton. Ultimately, Hammonton was selected. Although no definite source can be cited as to why Hammonton was selected over the other three sites, major reasons did include the potential quality of town life and the design of a safety zone. Additional testimony by Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins reveals this consideration: “We had to build rather attractive accommodations at Amatol. We had to make it just as attractive as we could in order to get people to stay there; particularly in view of the knowledge of most people of the danger.” Being situated between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, Amatol was conveniently located for ease of access to the Jersey Shore and a great metropolitan city. In addition to town amenities, Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins also explained that the size of Amatol—6,000 acres—was meant as a “substantial safety zone.” \n\nConstruction and Development\n\nAfter the final determination of the site had been made, the Atlantic Loading Company immediately went to work, which caught neighboring towns by surprise. The Tuckerton Beacon reported that on March 2, 1918, the residents of Elwood and Hammonton went to bed with a quiet night as it had been any other. To their surprise, they awoke to see a large force of strangers in their midst, a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend “Ordnance Department U.S.A.,” and heavy motor trucks noisily chugging in the streets. The next day, March 4, construction began.",
        "The isolated community swelled with workers who inhabited a new downtown with such amenities as a cafeteria, dance hall, and movie theater. World War I ended on Nov. 11, 1918 — Armistice Day, later commemorated as Veterans Day — and the 6,000-acre facility was soon shuttered, its buildings dismantled as swiftly as they’d been built. What little remained fell to ruin or was scrapped. Many of Amatol’s laborers, predominantly Irish and Polish from Philadelphia, stayed in the area and started families. Time, of course, has taken its toll on Amatol. Contracted by the federal government amid a world war the allies feared losing, it was built almost simultaneously with the better-known Bethlehem Loading Co. — or Belcoville — a munitions factory whose ruins are now part of the Atlantic County Park in Estell Manor. The Atlantic Loading Co. transformed a swath of the Pinelands into a grid of streets. Its name came from the type of explosive used in munitions. Mullica Township was chosen for its proximity to the rail line that ran from Philadelphia to Atlantic City and its relative isolation. At the time, the area was sparsely populated, an advantage in the event of an explosion at the plant. According to historical records, the workers’ city was sited two miles away from the factory in case of an explosion. Only two buildings from Amatol are still standing: the administration building became the now-abandoned State Police barracks outside Hammonton, and one of the houses was moved to the White Horse Pike, where it’s still occupied. Interestingly, many of Amatol’s buildings were designed to be temporary. The privately owned forest land behind the township’s recreational fields are strewn with bits of brick, concrete, and terra cotta — the materials used to construct these temporary structures. “That’s the cheap lath they made to separate the rooms,” Benner said. “It was plaster over wire mesh. When they disintegrated, (the plaster) fell out of the wire mesh.”\n\nThe Atlantic County Utilities Authority considered building a landfill on the Amatol site in the mid-1980s, but the proposal ultimately died in part because of potential environmental impacts and an organized opposition by township residents. Amatol is a story in itself.",
        "Amatol Munitions Factory\nAmatol is an abandoned munitions factory and\nassociated company town, located just a few\nmiles east of Hammonton. Constructed by the\nAtlantic Shell Loading Company, Amatol\nderives its name from the explosive loaded into\nthe shell as an accelerant for the projectile. In 1918, a year after the United States entered\nWorld War I, the government purchased 6,000\nacres of land to build a munitions plant and town. The speedy design and extensive use of concrete\nconstruction at Amatol was a major urban\nplanning achievement. In the span of nine\nmonths, the contractor completed houses,\ndormitories, bunk houses, schools, and other\nfacilities to accommodate between 10,000-\n20,000 plant workers and their families. The\nAmatol Railroad served to transport workers from their town to the factories located two miles away as\nwell as make connections with the West Jersey & Seashore Railroad. The plant closed down after the war ended and the federal government ordered a series of auctions for\neverything from the equipment in the manufacturing facilities to the buildings in the town between the\nyears 1919 and 1924. Within five years, the town and plant became a virtual memory, with just remnants of\nconcrete found throughout the site and the extant office building along the White Horse Pike, which later\nserved as a New Jersey State Police barracks. Amatol received a second chance when Charles Schwab bought the land in 1926 to construct a “wooden\nbowl” speedway. The wooden and oval track measured one and one-half miles long. Although it received\nhigh attendance at the opening, the racetrack only remained open for two years. Schwab leased the site as a\ntest track to automobile companies after losing interest in racing. Currently, the Mullica Township Recreation Association has taken over a portion of the site. Only one\nbuilding remains intact from the facility.",
        "It is the intention of this project to give new life to this wonderful document. Amatol Comes to Life\n\nThe United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance. In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen  incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine. The effect on local residents is best described in an article from a local newspaper of the time. The March 9, 1918 issue of the South Jersey Republican gives this account of the activity at the site:  \"Never in history was Hammonton so stirred up as on Sunday and Monday, when announcement was made that the Government had taken land four miles below here and proposed employing twenty thousand hands to erect buildings and load shells for war purposes. The papers were signed Saturday noon, and Sunday nearly a half hundred army trucks, loaded with tools, lumber and supplies, passed through town to the scene, at East Hammonton, this side of Elwood.\"\n\nConstruction\n\nConstruction on the plant began March 4, 1918. Two miles away from the plant site , the town that would house the workers, was also constructed. This distance would ensure the safety of the residents from any accidental explosions at the munition plant. This circumstance was dramatically demonstrated in the terrible accident at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lake Denmark, New Jersey in 1926. Both Amatol and Town-site were complete within nine months time. The plant was designed for safety and redundancy. The plant was laid out so that an explosion in one building should not damage any other buildings. This was accomplished by designing the buildings in such a way that an explosion would move upward rather than outward. Additional protection, in some cases, was provided with soil filled barricades. Hazardous operations were carried out in duplicate buildings so that if one were destroyed in an explosion the entire operation would not be jeopardized. The Plant\n\nAmatol was designed to load a whole series of shells. These ranged from 75 mm projectiles to hand grenades. The steel components were brought in by rail and distributed to a series of facilities designated to the loading of specific ordnance. In the book there is a photographic description of each one of these plants. There are also plans for the various buildings and for each plant which indicate the rail and conveyor connections among the buildings of the plant. These are the 75-mm plant, 4.7 inch plant, 6 inch plants, 8 inch plant, hand grenade plant, booster plant, and rifle grenade plant. Amatol was a great example of the newly emerging discipline of industrial organization. Though no direct attribution in given in the book to specific theorists of efficient industrial production a great emphasis is placed on the \"perfect organization, methods and equipment\" required to achieve the record production accomplished at Amatol. Plant Operation\n\nThe operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. :  \" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion...While the pressure of war needs was on it was necessary to load amatol rather than straight T.N.T.... The mix has as high explosive power as T.N.T., the one disadvantage of using it being that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of the shell loaded with straight T.N.T. is indefinite--certainly 25 years--while the condition of shell loaded with amatol would be uncertain after perhaps five years.\"\n\nPlant Safety\n\n\"In the matter of protection, the plant has been covered in many respects beyond the usual means of care to lessen risk. The operating buildings are practically all steel-frame with composite lath and cement construction or corrugated metal sides.",
        "Quite unexpectedly the necessities of war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil was easily worked and there was available a subterranean supply of excellent water readily tapped by driving wells. The moderate, healthful and equable climate was also suitable for a large industrial community. Early in the year 1918 the Company acquired for the Government a tract of 6000 acres of this land lying near the town of Hammonton, New Jersey. The Company began work on March 4th, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, laid out and built a new town and an enormous plant, peopled the former with workmen and equipped the latter with machinery and begun the loading of shell. The transformation of the wilderness into a hive of industry within such a short time was one of the many war-time marvels of American engineering achievement. The history of the work is a story of the accomplishment of brain power, engineering talent and the genius of American business organization, which reflects the highest credit upon all concerned. The leaders in the formation of the Atlantic Loading Company were O."

        "SCOPE OF THE WORK\n\nIn April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers. The achievements of 1918 showed how well this work had been done in 1917. Once the lathes and the forges were working it became necessary to supply the high explosives with which to charge the shell they turned out, and to provide extensive machinery for doing the charging. Contracts were made for the production on a vast scale of trinitrotoluol, the destructive explosive used in modern big gun ammunition, and other contracts for the construction of plants for the loading of the shell as fast as the mills turned them out. Four large shell loading plants were projected and eventually placed in operation, namely, those of the Bethlehem Loading Co., the T. A. Gillespie Loading Co., the DuPont Engineering Co. and the Atlantic Loading Company. Of these the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company is the largest. It is located at Amatol, New Jersey—a town which came into being to house its workers, and is about 25 miles from Atlantic City, adjacent to and north of the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads. The site consists of a tract of approximately 6,000 acres of land, with its western boundary about six miles east of Hammonton, New Jersey. The history of the Atlantic Loading Company is a story of organization, construction and production in quick-step time. It entered into a contract with the Ordnance Department of the Government to act as its agent in loading and storing shell, and it conducted its work and enterprise from first to last in accordance with the rules and regulations of that department. It began the work of construction on its plant on March 4, 1918, began operations the following July, and in August loaded its first shell, and in the meantime it also had built the new town of Amatol. An indication of the high speed with which its operations were conducted may be found in the fact that within twenty-four hours after the site was finally determined upon, actual work on clearing the land for the plant was under way. The enterprise combined two separate and distinct undertakings, either of which in itself would require an organization embracing high skill, initiative and intensive working power. One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made ready to house the workers at the same time. It was in contemplation of this that the Atlantic Loading Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine in December, 1917. The stated purposes of the corporation were: first, to construct and operate a shell loading plant for the production of completed rounds of ammunition and to provide the necessary storage capacity therefor; second, to build a town for the housing of the operatives. The plant was designed to be the largest of its type in the country, providing for the loading of shell of all sizes from 75 mm, to 10-inch drop bombs, depth bombs, rifle grenades, hand grenades and boosters. The charter provisions were very broad, in order to permit the Company to enter into contracts for construction of any and all kinds, such as steam and electric railroads, manufacturing plants, electrical transmission lines, power developments, buildings and bridges.

        "\nLOCATE WAR PLANT AT TOMS RIVER \n\nAtlantic Loading Co. Will Make Shells at New Factory To Employ 20,000 Men. Residents of Ocean County are very much interested over the announcement that the Atlantic Loading company of New York has practically decided to locate the big loading plant at this place. There has been a good deal of uncertainty for the past two weeks as to where the plant would be located, four sites having been under consideration: the Davenport tract here, the Bidwell-Stone property at Lakehurst, the Cedar Crest site, and a site at Hammonton. Engineers of the War Department have been here for more than two weeks plotting and testing out the ground, and while no exact statement has been made as to the selection, an automobile load of blueprints for the buildings arrived from New York last night, followed by 10 engineers and contractors today. Officials of the War Department and of the Atlantic Loading Company have been in consultation all day with George W. Holman, president of the Ocean County Trust Company, William M. Blecher, editor of the Toms River Courier, and George O. Van Ness, president of the County Tax Board, who have been the leaders in the fight to get the plant located here, and they’ve practically assured them the site here will be selected. The plant will load shells for the government, and not manufacture ammunition, as was at first stated. The proposed site is along the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, having a railroad frontage of more than five miles, and will consist of some 900 acres. Options on all the land have been secured and are in the hands of the engineers while the titles are being searched at the county clerk’s office. It has been stated that the plant will open with 400 men and will increase until 20,000 are employed. It had been the original intention of the company to locate at Hanover Farms, 10 miles west of this place, and work was begun, when it was discovered that the water used at the plant came from the same stream that supplies Camp Dix, and the work was stopped on orders from the War Department. Immediately the board of trade put the matter in the hands of Mr. Holman, Mr. Blecher, and Mr. Van Ness, who secured options on this tract with the result so far achieved. The site under consideration is located on what is locally known as the Chemical Company property and the Davenport section. The Chemical property was owned and operated by the Davis Chemical Company for a number of years and was later recarried into the bankruptcy courts by the creditors of the company.

Though no direct attribution in given in the book to specific theorists of efficient industrial production a great emphasis is placed on the \"perfect organization, methods and equipment\" required to achieve the record production accomplished at Amatol. Plant Operation\n\nThe operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. :  \" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench. In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion...While the pressure of war needs was on it was necessary to load amatol rather than straight T.N.T.... The mix has as high explosive power as T.N.T., the one disadvantage of using it being that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of the shell loaded with straight T.N.T. is indefinite--certainly 25 years--while the condition of shell loaded with amatol would be uncertain after perhaps five years.\"\n\nPlant Safety\n\n\"In the matter of protection, the plant has been covered in many respects beyond the usual means of care to lessen risk. The operating buildings are practically all steel-frame with composite lath and cement construction or corrugated metal sides.",
        "J. Salisbury, of Salt Lake City, Utah, J. D. Evans, of the Evans Engineering Corporation, and the Electric Bond and Share Company, of New York, both of whom have had extensive experience in the financing and construction of large works. The new Company was formed by taking the pick of men from several large organizations, including that of the Electric Bond and Share Company, so that each of its men was made up of experts. This method of selecting suitable men was followed throughout the organization, the financial and administrative chiefs as well as the engineers being picked men. The new organization having in its personnel many of the pioneers in the quantity loading of high explosive shell, embodied in its plant at Amatol the best, most economical and safest methods which could be devised for facilitating and speeding up production. Some of these methods were developed by the Company's own engineers: the power belt conveyor system, which permits the continuous movement of shell through the various operations within the central loading building, is one feature. The men placed in charge of operating the plant thus brought to the work at Amatol the skill necessary to successful operation. The speed with which the call of the Government was met, the co-ordination of plant and men and the results obtained which provided for every contingency stand out as prominent features of the work. In the following pages Mr. Hammel, the Company's Chief Engineer, and a Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, has creditably presented an all-too-brief history of this great undertaking, which includes an interesting description of the plant and the town, their construction, operation, capacity, and the efficient organization which made them possible. It is eminently fitting that a permanent record should be made of the achievements of the Company, which may well be proud of its work, for success never attended a larger undertaking initiated and carried through in such a short time and in the face of so many difficulties. Amatol, New Jersey\nJanuary, 1919",
        "GRAHAM. Well, was that under some order of the Secretary of War, or somebody, that that was done? COL. HAWKINS. In November, I think it was, of 1917, Gen. Crozier submitted this to the General Staff, and my recollection is that the Secretary of War approved it, but did not approve it in writing. Later on, we got his written approval, in the latter part of 1918. MR. GRAHAM. From the Secretary of War? COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir. MR. GRAHAM. Was it after the armistice? COL. HAWKINS. No, sir; it was in September of 1918, I should think. But our original submission of the whole scheme was made in November of 1917, and the contracts were let to most of these companies on the 3rd of December, 1917, and the first one in operation that I recollect was the Gillespie Co. loading plant at Morgan, N.J., and the second one in operation was the Atlantic Loading Co. plant and the third the California loading plant; I am unable to state when the Penneman plant got into operation. MR. GRAHAM. Now, let us see about this loading plant. In times of peace is there any purpose for any such plant? COL.",
