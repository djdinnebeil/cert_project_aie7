        "Daniel B. Frazier, owner of a great part of the tract on which the new war industry will stand, worked diligently with J. B. Manly, of Somers Point, as his agent, among the few owners of the property who were holding out for bigger prices. They had practically completed their task before the day closed, and the word went out tonight that work on the great plant will positively begin tomorrow.\n\nTwo hundred men will arrive late tonight and this number will be increased to at least 1000 before tomorrow night. ```",
        "war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil",
        "getting people to work from that time on. And we had to take soldier labor and put soldiers in some of these plants. We had considerable labor at the plants after that explosion, and before that we were offering them every sort of inducement to get people to work in those plants, and we had to make it pretty attractive to them.",
        "The achievements of 1918 showed how well this work had been done in 1917. Once the lathes and the forges were working it became necessary to supply the high explosives with which to charge the shell they turned out, and to provide extensive machinery for doing the charging. Contracts were made for the production on a vast scale of trinitrotoluol, the destructive explosive used in modern big gun ammunition, and other contracts for the construction of plants for the loading of the shell as fast as the mills turned them out.",
        "In April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers.",
        "The very nature of the work required an organization of experts. These were drafted from going concerns engaged in large construction and financial enterprises. Loading shell with high explosives is a hazardous undertaking, and the men who formed the Atlantic Loading Company realized this. They summoned to their aid only men of broad experience along similar lines who had proven their fitness in successful work elsewhere. In an incredibly short time a suitable organization was mapped out and the necessary specialists were recruited to head the",
        "MR. GRAHAM. You were working at it, were you?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.\nMR. GRAHAM. Knowing, as you did, that a picric-acid plant must necessarily be only for use and operation during the war and that after the war was over you would have no further use for such a plant, why were not those buildings made of temporary character, such as would suffice for the period of the war and to be abandoned after the war was over?",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Did you build buildings there?\nCOL. HAWKINS. We started a plant there in March, 1918, and we went into active operation in July, and very complete operations by the time the armistice was signed. Following that the plant was turned over to the commanding officer and it is now a permanent ordnance plant.\nMR. GRAHAM. Is it proposed to keep this permanently?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; that was turned over to the commanding officer, Col. Miles, and he is doing a certain amount of loading there to-day.\nMR. GRAHAM. Loading what; shells?",
        "The United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance.  In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen  incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine.  The effect on local residents is best described in an article from a local newspaper of the time.  The March",

But our original submission of the whole scheme was made in November of 1917, and the contracts were let to most of these companies on the 3rd of December, 1917, and the first one in operation that I recollect was the Gillespie Co. loading plant at Morgan, N.J., and the second one in operation was the Atlantic Loading Co. plant and the third the California loading plant; I am unable to state when the Penneman plant got into operation.",
        "They learned that the strangers were made up of real estate men, whose work in securing the huge tract on which a shell-loading plant will stand has been practically completed; of construction workers in the employ of the Atlantic Loading Company, of New York, to which has been awarded the work of erecting the plant; and a force of engineers attached to the War Department. ```",
        "The history of the Atlantic Loading Company is a story of organization, construction and production in quick-step time. It entered into a contract with the Ordnance Department of the Government to act as its agent in loading and storing shell, and it conducted its work and enterprise from first to last in accordance with the rules and regulations of that department. It began the work of construction on its plant on March 4, 1918, began operations the following July, and in August loaded its first shell, and in the meantime it also had built",
        "To get the materials with which to build was no less difficult. Those were the days of unlimited demand and undeveloped supplies, of congested freight carrying facilities and Government priority orders for shipments. It was easy to order supplies, but quite another matter to get them. The purchasing department of the Company rose to the emergency by organizing a special expediting division. This division dispatched men to various seats of supply, such as the lumber mills of the South, and these men followed the orders placed by the Company",
        "Construction naturally was the first thing on the programme. In all construction the two main factors are labor and materials. Even in normal times these factors are difficult problems in any large undertaking. In the early part of the year 1918, with the whole country absorbed in war work and with normal conditions completely upset, they presented ten-fold more difficulties. To get labor with which to build its plant and town the Company was compelled to go into a labor market booming from unprecedented demand and to bid against high wages in",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Gave power for what?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Gave power to the Secretary of War to buy land for purposes of this kind.\nMR. GRAHAM. General power?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Well, he had ample power before to buy cantonments and camp sites and then on May 11, 1918, they gave broader powers, and then we did begin to negotiate for the purchase of various plants and on the 22d of May the Secretary of War delegated authority in the matter of procuring real estate to the Real Estate Service under the Purchase, Storage and Traffic Division.",
        "The work of the Women’s Department went on and women, was made very difficult, because of the shortage incident to the demands made upon them by the abnormal war industrial activities. Admirable results were obtained, particularly by the Superintendent of Women to whom was entrusted the direct direction of the organizations for recreational and communal life, as well as the employment and housing of women.",

        "As the morning progressed gaily decorated automobiles made their appearance on the Atlantic avenue, and by noon there was a steady procession of cars up and down the avenue. All business was suspended and all offices were closed for the day and all joined in the merry-making.\n\nMunition workers employed in the plants at Belcoville and Amatol learned of the signing of the armistice on their way to work at 6 o'clock. They immediately turned back and operations at the two big plants were practically suspended."

It is understood that orders have been issued by the Federal authorities that many million shells must be finished by December 31 and that every employee including the troops, who, it is said, will get down to civilian tasks for a month at least, must exert every effort to complete the allotment.",

The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance.  In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen  incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine.

We had considerable labor at the plants after that explosion, and before that we were offering them every sort of inducement to get people to work in those plants, and we had to make it pretty attractive to them.",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Now, let us see about this loading plant. In times of peace is there any purpose for any such plant?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes; we have to have some loading facilities. We have done a good deal of it by contractors.\nMR. GRAHAM. How is that?\nCOL. HAWKINS. We have done some by contractors and some in our establishments.\nMR. GRAHAM. Is it the purpose of the Government to try to run this institution in peace times?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.\nMR. GRAHAM. At Amatol?",

Well, he had ample power before to buy cantonments and camp sites and then on May 11, 1918, they gave broader powers, and then we did begin to negotiate for the purchase of various plants and on the 22d of May the Secretary of War delegated authority in the matter of procuring real estate to the Real Estate Service under the Purchase, Storage and Traffic Division."

But our original submission of the whole scheme was made in November of 1917, and the contracts were let to most of these companies on the 3rd of December, 1917, and the first one in operation that I recollect was the Gillespie Co. loading plant at Morgan, N.J., and the second one in operation was the Atlantic Loading Co. plant and the third the California loading plant; I am unable to state when the Penneman plant got into operation.",

      "response": "The company town and community development of Amatol were closely integrated with its town planning and safety measures during its construction. The planning process was characterized by a focus on speed, simplicity, and results, emphasizing rapid construction of a well-organized community designed to accommodate a large workforce. The town was laid out in a grid pattern with residential streets and worker housing, constructed with materials and designs aimed at resistance to weather and swift assembly, often utilizing temporary structures that could be dismantled if necessary.\n\nSafety was a paramount consideration in the town's development. The town was situated approximately two miles from the munitions plant to ensure residents' safety from potential accidents, such as explosions. The layout of the plant and town was designed for safety and redundancy, with the plant itself planned to minimize risk through its configuration. The entire project, including both the town and plant, was completed within nine months, reflecting a focus on rapid deployment while maintaining safety protocols.\n\nAdditionally, the town’s infrastructure—including water, sewage, electric systems, and amenities—was modern and designed to provide a comfortable living environment, which helped in keeping the population satisfied and productive. Many buildings in Amatol were designed with temporary construction in mind due to the urgent wartime needs, and only a few structures remain today. Overall, the development of Amatol exemplifies a community planned with an emphasis on efficiency, safety, and suitable living conditions for its rapid creation during a critical wartime period.",

The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed. In just nine months’ time, the new town and manufactory were completed reaching a population of 7,000. Today,",

The privately owned forest land behind the township’s recreational fields are strewn with bits of brick, concrete, and terra cotta — the materials used to construct these temporary structures.",

      "question": "How did the wartime industrial production at amatol relate to the us involvement in WW1 and how did the town planning support the war effort?",
      "response": "The wartime industrial production at Amatol was directly related to the United States' involvement in World War I. After the US entered the war in April 1917, there was an urgent need to expand munitions manufacturing to support the war effort. Consequently, the government purchased 6,000 acres of land in New Jersey to quickly construct a large munitions plant called Amatol, along with a nearby town to house the thousands of workers needed. \n\nThe construction of Amatol was a remarkable feat of urban planning, completed in just nine months, and included residential housing, schools, and various facilities to support a large workforce. The town was carefully designed with modern amenities such as electric lighting, sewage systems, water plants, entertainment facilities, and transportation infrastructure like the Amatol Railroad. Its spatial separation from the plant—about two miles—was a safety measure to protect residents from potential accidents at the munitions factory.\n\nThe industrial output at Amatol was vital for supplying munitions, including shells and other explosive materials, which were crucial for the war effort. The rapid development and efficient organization of the plant demonstrated the strategic mobilization of resources and industrial capacity in support of the US military during WWI. \n\nIn summary, Amatol’s industrial production was a pivotal element of America’s wartime efforts, with town planning supporting the war effort by enabling the swift and efficient assembly of a large workforce housed in a well-planned community that facilitated rapid industrial output and logistical support for WWI.",

The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed. In just nine months’ time, the new town and manufactory were completed reaching a population of 7,000. Today,",
        "In 1917, the US entered the War. Then, in 1918, the US built a plant to supply munitions to the armed forces. It purchased 6000 acres of land a few miles east of Hammonton, NJ, and built a munitions plant and a town to house the 10,000-20,000 plant workers. The plant made munitions of many different types and sizes, and was called Amatol.\n\nThe town of Amatol was built two miles away.

        "The history of Amatol begins in December 1917 with the incorporation of the Atlantic Loading Company. Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected. In addition, there were also concerns over the safety of soldiers at Camp Dix",

        "Development was rapid. By June, the population was nearly 2,000, and train service was added. By August, advertisements for Amatol described it as “a city with all modern improvements with electric lights, a fire department, a police department, a modern sewage system, a modern water plant, a theatre, a Y.M.C.A, an auditorium, bowling alleys, and other city amenities.” Amatol also promised many employment opportunities, not just with the munitions plant, but with local businesses, like barbers, tailors, jewelers, watchmakers, and grocers.",

        "In April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers.",
        "This town was planned out well and was built quickly. It included a residential section consisting of houses, dormitories, bunk houses, schools and churches. The industrial section had water, electric and sewage plants. There was a bowling alley, swimming pool, YMCA, tennis courts, and a movie theater for entertainment. The Amatol Railroad was built to transport workers between the plant and town.",
        "The United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance.  In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen  incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine.

A few of the soldiers were jailed when they were unable to show “leave of absence.” By the time of the armistice, there were 3,800 officers and enlisted men at Camp Amatol, as it became known.",

It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil",

The men associated in this project have produced all told over 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition of various types.",
        "The history of the Atlantic Loading Company is a story of organization, construction and production in quick-step time. It entered into a contract with the Ordnance Department of the Government to act as its agent in loading and storing shell, and it conducted its work and enterprise from first to last in accordance with the rules and regulations of that department. It began the work of construction on its plant on March 4, 1918, began operations the following July, and in August loaded its first shell, and in the meantime it also had built",
        "The achievements of 1918 showed how well this work had been done in 1917. Once the lathes and the forges were working it became necessary to supply the high explosives with which to charge the shell they turned out, and to provide extensive machinery for doing the charging. Contracts were made for the production on a vast scale of trinitrotoluol, the destructive explosive used in modern big gun ammunition, and other contracts for the construction of plants for the loading of the shell as fast as the mills turned them out.",
        "Loading operations at the Amatol plant began on July 31, 1918, and on August 3, the first shell was loaded. The plant was capable of loading “60,000 shells of all sizes, 50,000 boosters, 50,000 hand grenades, and 20,000 rifle grenades per day, as well as components. To accomplish this work there were 15 smokeless-powder magazines, 33 T.N.T. magazines, 49 miscellaneous storage buildings, 642 plant structures in all.” The plant, during its operational lifespan, loaded over 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition of various types and sizes.",

The men placed in charge of operating the plant thus",
        "The Company's engineers were the first to use belt conveyors in the production of shell. To turn out shell in large quantity and economically this operation must be one continuous process from the receiving room to the final stage. The conveyors carry the shell continuously from the first stage to the last with a resultant maximum economy of time and labor. No other plant has used the same system of loading as that worked out by the Atlantic Loading Company.",
        "The enterprise combined two separate and distinct undertakings, either of which in itself would require an organization embracing high skill, initiative and intensive working power. One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made",
        "The very nature of the work required an organization of experts. These were drafted from going concerns engaged in large construction and financial enterprises. Loading shell with high explosives is a hazardous undertaking, and the men who formed the Atlantic Loading Company realized this. They summoned to their aid only men of broad experience along similar lines who had proven their fitness in successful work elsewhere. In an incredibly short time a suitable organization was mapped out and the necessary specialists were recruited to head the",

The remover heads are placed at a revolving shaft, and the men engage the plug and unscrew it.",
        "The plant reached a production of 16,000 shell of this type in a day of eight hours. However, on account of Government requirements, this unit was compelled to load both 75 mm shell and aerial drop bombs.

      "question": "How did the development and subsequent disappearance of the Amatol munitions factory in New Jersey reflect the United States' wartime efforts during World War I, and what lasting impacts did this have on the local community and historical documentation?",
      "response": "The development of the Amatol munitions factory in New Jersey was a significant reflection of the United States' wartime efforts during World War I. Built rapidly in 1918, just a year after the U.S. entered the war, the facility exemplified the nation's urgent need to boost its military manufacturing capabilities. The government contracted the Atlantic Loading Company to construct and operate a large munition plant that could produce large quantities of shells and grenades to support the war effort. The plant and the associated town, built in record time—within nine months—highlighted the intensive mobilization of industrial resources and labor, with the town housing between 10,000 and 20,000 workers and their families, and embodying a significant urban planning achievement of the period.\n\nThe plant's existence was closely tied to the wartime imperative to quickly produce armaments; it loaded over 9 million rounds and various munitions in its operational period. However, once World War I ended in November 1918, the need for such massive wartime production diminished abruptly. The Amatol plant was shut down shortly after the war, with the government auctioning off equipment and dismantling the infrastructure by 1919-1924. The town itself rapidly disappeared, with only remnants like a former police barracks and one house remaining today, and the site largely returning to forest.\n\nThis rapid development and subsequent abandonment had lasting impacts on the local community and historical documentation. Many of the laborers, who were mostly Irish and Polish from nearby Philadelphia, remained in the area and started families, contributing to the local demographic fabric. The story of Amatol has become a part of local history, showcasing the intense but transient nature of wartime industrial communities. Its rapid rise and fall have been thoroughly documented in photographs, books, and reports, preserving the memory of this brief but significant chapter in American wartime industrial efforts.\n\nIn summary, the Amatol factory's development reflected the U.S. mobilization and industrial acceleration during WWI, and its quick disappearance underscored the war’s sudden end and the shifting economic landscape. The site’s history continues to influence local historical narratives and environmental considerations, serving as a reminder of wartime exigencies and their lasting footprint on communities and historical record-keeping.",

The isolated community swelled with workers who inhabited a new downtown with such amenities as a cafeteria, dance hall, and movie theater.",
        "What was the overall impact of Amatol on the surrounding area? There is no reliable and readily-available information to answer this question. Where did the residents of Amatol go once operations ceased? According to the Press of Atlantic City, “Many of Amatol’s laborers, predominantly Irish and Polish from Philadelphia, stayed in the area and started families.”",
        "Loading operations at the Amatol plant began on July 31, 1918, and on August 3, the first shell was loaded. The plant was capable of loading “60,000 shells of all sizes, 50,000 boosters, 50,000 hand grenades, and 20,000 rifle grenades per day, as well as components. To accomplish this work there were 15 smokeless-powder magazines, 33 T.N.T. magazines, 49 miscellaneous storage buildings, 642 plant structures in all.” The plant, during its operational lifespan, loaded over 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition of various types and sizes."

The plant was situated adjacent to and north of the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads, which offered ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The existence of thirty-five miles of railroad trackage connected with the Pennsylvania Railroad main line between Camden and Atlantic City, enabling efficient movement of workers, equipment, and raw materials.

The men placed in charge of operating the plant thus",
        "The operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. :  \" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process.  When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench.  In the case of large, heavy shell this method not only saves time, but a vast amount of physical exertion...While the pressure of war needs was on it was necessary to load amatol rather than",
        "The Company's engineers were the first to use belt conveyors in the production of shell. To turn out shell in large quantity and economically this operation must be one continuous process from the receiving room to the final stage. The conveyors carry the shell continuously from the first stage to the last with a resultant maximum economy of time and labor. No other plant has used the same system of loading as that worked out by the Atlantic Loading Company.",
