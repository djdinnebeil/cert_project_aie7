      "response": "James Blaine Walker was the Secretary of the Public Service Commission for the 1st District of New York and an author, notably of \"Fifty Years of Rapid Transit.\" In relation to rapid wartime industrial mobilization, he appears to have played a role as an example of an organized, official figure involved in infrastructure and public services during the period of increased industrial activity, such as in the context of war efforts. However, based on the provided context, there is no specific information indicating that he directly led or organized the wartime industrial mobilization efforts.",

        "INTRODUCTION\nBY JAMES BLAINE WALKER\nSecretary Public Service Commission, 1st Dist. New York; Author of \"Fifty Years of Rapid Transit,\" etc.",
        "Daniel B. Frazier, owner of a great part of the tract on which the new war industry will stand, worked diligently with J. B. Manly, of Somers Point, as his agent, among the few owners of the property who were holding out for bigger prices. They had practically completed their task before the day closed, and the word went out tonight that work on the great plant will positively begin tomorrow.\n\nTwo hundred men will arrive late tonight and this number will be increased to at least 1000 before tomorrow night. ```",
        "getting people to work from that time on. And we had to take soldier labor and put soldiers in some of these plants. We had considerable labor at the plants after that explosion, and before that we were offering them every sort of inducement to get people to work in those plants, and we had to make it pretty attractive to them.",
        "war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil",
        "In April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers.",
        "The very nature of the work required an organization of experts. These were drafted from going concerns engaged in large construction and financial enterprises. Loading shell with high explosives is a hazardous undertaking, and the men who formed the Atlantic Loading Company realized this. They summoned to their aid only men of broad experience along similar lines who had proven their fitness in successful work elsewhere. In an incredibly short time a suitable organization was mapped out and the necessary specialists were recruited to head the",
        "MR. GRAHAM. You were working at it, were you?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.\nMR. GRAHAM. Knowing, as you did, that a picric-acid plant must necessarily be only for use and operation during the war and that after the war was over you would have no further use for such a plant, why were not those buildings made of temporary character, such as would suffice for the period of the war and to be abandoned after the war was over?",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Gave power for what?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Gave power to the Secretary of War to buy land for purposes of this kind.\nMR. GRAHAM. General power?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Well, he had ample power before to buy cantonments and camp sites and then on May 11, 1918, they gave broader powers, and then we did begin to negotiate for the purchase of various plants and on the 22d of May the Secretary of War delegated authority in the matter of procuring real estate to the Real Estate Service under the Purchase, Storage and Traffic Division.",
        "To get the materials with which to build was no less difficult. Those were the days of unlimited demand and undeveloped supplies, of congested freight carrying facilities and Government priority orders for shipments. It was easy to order supplies, but quite another matter to get them. The purchasing department of the Company rose to the emergency by organizing a special expediting division. This division dispatched men to various seats of supply, such as the lumber mills of the South, and these men followed the orders placed by the Company",
        "They learned that the strangers were made up of real estate men, whose work in securing the huge tract on which a shell-loading plant will stand has been practically completed; of construction workers in the employ of the Atlantic Loading Company, of New York, to which has been awarded the work of erecting the plant; and a force of engineers attached to the War Department. ```",
        "In 1918, a year after the United States entered\nWorld War I, the government purchased 6,000\nacres of land to build a munitions plant and town.\nThe speedy design and extensive use of concrete\nconstruction at Amatol was a major urban\nplanning achievement. In the span of nine\nmonths, the contractor completed houses,\ndormitories, bunk houses, schools, and other\nfacilities to accommodate between 10,000-\n20,000 plant workers and their families. The",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Did you build buildings there?\nCOL. HAWKINS. We started a plant there in March, 1918, and we went into active operation in July, and very complete operations by the time the armistice was signed. Following that the plant was turned over to the commanding officer and it is now a permanent ordnance plant.\nMR. GRAHAM. Is it proposed to keep this permanently?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; that was turned over to the commanding officer, Col. Miles, and he is doing a certain amount of loading there to-day.\nMR. GRAHAM. Loading what; shells?",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Was it after the armistice?\nCOL. HAWKINS. No, sir; it was in September of 1918, I should think. But our original submission of the whole scheme was made in November of 1917, and the contracts were let to most of these companies on the 3rd of December, 1917, and the first one in operation that I recollect was the Gillespie Co. loading plant at Morgan, N.J., and the second one in operation was the Atlantic Loading Co. plant and the third the California loading plant; I am unable to state when the Penneman plant got into operation.",
        "The enterprise combined two separate and distinct undertakings, either of which in itself would require an organization embracing high skill, initiative and intensive working power. One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Now, let us see about this loading plant. In times of peace is there any purpose for any such plant?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes; we have to have some loading facilities. We have done a good deal of it by contractors.\nMR. GRAHAM. How is that?\nCOL. HAWKINS. We have done some by contractors and some in our establishments.\nMR. GRAHAM. Is it the purpose of the Government to try to run this institution in peace times?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.\nMR. GRAHAM. At Amatol?"

The Company began work on March 4th, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, laid out and built a new town and an enormous plant, peopled the former with workmen and equipped the latter with machinery and begun the loading of shell. The transformation of the wilderness into a hive of industry within such a short time was one of the many war-time marvels of American engineering achievement.",
        "In 1917, the US entered the War. Then, in 1918, the US built a plant to supply munitions to the armed forces. It purchased 6000 acres of land a few miles east of Hammonton, NJ, and built a munitions plant and a town to house the 10,000-20,000 plant workers.

The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed.

In total, 1,600 acres had to be cleared for the plant, and 38 acres had to be cleared and 255 acres trimmed for the town. This was no easy task. The land was mostly wooded with some acres of swamp and was difficult to clear due to a “dense, tangled nature of growth.” The initial workforce included forty men, and within the first week, the",
        "Other sites were considered, including Toms River, Lakehurst, Lacey, and Hammonton. Ultimately, Hammonton was selected. Although no definite source can be cited as to why Hammonton was selected over the other three sites, major reasons did include the potential quality of town life and the design of a safety zone.
