        "INTRODUCTION\nBY JAMES BLAINE WALKER\nSecretary Public Service Commission, 1st Dist. New York; Author of \"Fifty Years of Rapid Transit,\" etc.",
        "Daniel B. Frazier, owner of a great part of the tract on which the new war industry will stand, worked diligently with J. B. Manly, of Somers Point, as his agent, among the few owners of the property who were holding out for bigger prices. They had practically completed their task before the day closed, and the word went out tonight that work on the great plant will positively begin tomorrow.\n\nTwo hundred men will arrive late tonight and this number will be increased to at least 1000 before tomorrow night. ```",
        "getting people to work from that time on. And we had to take soldier labor and put soldiers in some of these plants. We had considerable labor at the plants after that explosion, and before that we were offering them every sort of inducement to get people to work in those plants, and we had to make it pretty attractive to them.",
        "war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil",
        "In April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers.",
        "The very nature of the work required an organization of experts. These were drafted from going concerns engaged in large construction and financial enterprises. Loading shell with high explosives is a hazardous undertaking, and the men who formed the Atlantic Loading Company realized this. They summoned to their aid only men of broad experience along similar lines who had proven their fitness in successful work elsewhere. In an incredibly short time a suitable organization was mapped out and the necessary specialists were recruited to head the",
        "MR. GRAHAM. You were working at it, were you?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.\nMR. GRAHAM. Knowing, as you did, that a picric-acid plant must necessarily be only for use and operation during the war and that after the war was over you would have no further use for such a plant, why were not those buildings made of temporary character, such as would suffice for the period of the war and to be abandoned after the war was over?",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Gave power for what?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Gave power to the Secretary of War to buy land for purposes of this kind.\nMR. GRAHAM. General power?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Well, he had ample power before to buy cantonments and camp sites and then on May 11, 1918, they gave broader powers, and then we did begin to negotiate for the purchase of various plants and on the 22d of May the Secretary of War delegated authority in the matter of procuring real estate to the Real Estate Service under the Purchase, Storage and Traffic Division.",
        "To get the materials with which to build was no less difficult. Those were the days of unlimited demand and undeveloped supplies, of congested freight carrying facilities and Government priority orders for shipments. It was easy to order supplies, but quite another matter to get them. The purchasing department of the Company rose to the emergency by organizing a special expediting division. This division dispatched men to various seats of supply, such as the lumber mills of the South, and these men followed the orders placed by the Company",
        "They learned that the strangers were made up of real estate men, whose work in securing the huge tract on which a shell-loading plant will stand has been practically completed; of construction workers in the employ of the Atlantic Loading Company, of New York, to which has been awarded the work of erecting the plant; and a force of engineers attached to the War Department. ```",
        "In 1918, a year after the United States entered\nWorld War I, the government purchased 6,000\nacres of land to build a munitions plant and town.\nThe speedy design and extensive use of concrete\nconstruction at Amatol was a major urban\nplanning achievement. In the span of nine\nmonths, the contractor completed houses,\ndormitories, bunk houses, schools, and other\nfacilities to accommodate between 10,000-\n20,000 plant workers and their families. The",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Did you build buildings there?\nCOL. HAWKINS. We started a plant there in March, 1918, and we went into active operation in July, and very complete operations by the time the armistice was signed. Following that the plant was turned over to the commanding officer and it is now a permanent ordnance plant.\nMR. GRAHAM. Is it proposed to keep this permanently?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; that was turned over to the commanding officer, Col. Miles, and he is doing a certain amount of loading there to-day.\nMR. GRAHAM. Loading what; shells?",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Was it after the armistice?\nCOL. HAWKINS. No, sir; it was in September of 1918, I should think. But our original submission of the whole scheme was made in November of 1917, and the contracts were let to most of these companies on the 3rd of December, 1917, and the first one in operation that I recollect was the Gillespie Co. loading plant at Morgan, N.J., and the second one in operation was the Atlantic Loading Co. plant and the third the California loading plant; I am unable to state when the Penneman plant got into operation.",
        "The enterprise combined two separate and distinct undertakings, either of which in itself would require an organization embracing high skill, initiative and intensive working power. One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Now, let us see about this loading plant. In times of peace is there any purpose for any such plant?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes; we have to have some loading facilities. We have done a good deal of it by contractors.\nMR. GRAHAM. How is that?\nCOL. HAWKINS. We have done some by contractors and some in our establishments.\nMR. GRAHAM. Is it the purpose of the Government to try to run this institution in peace times?\nCOL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.\nMR. GRAHAM. At Amatol?"

The Company began work on March 4th, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, laid out and built a new town and an enormous plant, peopled the former with workmen and equipped the latter with machinery and begun the loading of shell. The transformation of the wilderness into a hive of industry within such a short time was one of the many war-time marvels of American engineering achievement.",

It purchased 6000 acres of land a few miles east of Hammonton, NJ, and built a munitions plant and a town to house the 10,000-20,000 plant workers.

The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed.

In total, 1,600 acres had to be cleared for the plant, and 38 acres had to be cleared and 255 acres trimmed for the town. This was no easy task. The land was mostly wooded with some acres of swamp and was difficult to clear due to a “dense, tangled nature of growth.” The initial workforce included forty men, and within the first week, the",
        "Other sites were considered, including Toms River, Lakehurst, Lacey, and Hammonton. Ultimately, Hammonton was selected. Although no definite source can be cited as to why Hammonton was selected over the other three sites, major reasons did include the potential quality of town life and the design of a safety zone.

Early construction and housing conditions were limited, resulting in high turnover, especially among female workers. As efforts were made to improve living standards—such as building organized dormitories, recreation, and entertainment facilities—employee morale increased. \n\nDuring major industrial and wartime efforts, like the construction of the Amatol plant during World War I, there was a significant emphasis on making work attractive to secure labor. Inducements and improved housing conditions were used to attract and retain workers, many of whom came from immigrant communities such as Irish and Polish populations. \n\nMoreover, the overall history shows that labor was not merely about employment but also about fostering a living environment conducive to stability and well-being, which in turn enhanced productivity and morale. After wartime operations ceased, many workers remained in the area, establishing families, suggesting a degree of community stability linked to improving living conditions.",

It was a major challenge for the US to quickly increase manufacturing capacity to support the war effort. This increase in munitions production was also a big deal for Germany, as it meant Germany faced the challenge of countering the increased Allied supply and maintaining its own war efforts.",

      "response": "The community development and town planning of Amatol were closely related to its safety measures during construction, emphasizing speed, functionality, and worker welfare. The town was designed with careful consideration to create a well-organized, attractive, and stimulating environment for its residents, featuring residential housing, schools, churches, and recreational facilities such as a bowling alley, swimming pool, YMCA, and tennis courts. This comprehensive planning aimed to keep the population satisfied and support rapid industrial production.\n\nIn terms of safety and efficient construction, extensive use of concrete and rapid development practices were employed. The construction was completed within a remarkably short timeframe—around nine months—using innovative urban planning principles and focusing on the speed and safety of construction. The land was mostly wooded and swampy, requiring significant clearing, which posed safety challenges that were addressed through quick, large-scale efforts and extensive planning.\n\nFurthermore, many of the buildings were designed to be temporary, reflecting safety considerations related to the urgency of the war effort and logistical constraints. This design choice facilitated swift construction and eventual dismantling after wartime needs diminished, which was a safety measure in itself—reducing long-term hazards and structural liabilities.\n\nOverall, the planning of Amatol was aimed at creating a safe, efficient, and attractive community that could rapidly support a large workforce during wartime, utilizing innovative construction techniques and comprehensive urban planning principles to ensure safety and functionality.",

Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected. In addition, there were also concerns over the safety of soldiers at Camp Dix",
        "As a result of America’s entry into World War I, Atlantic County received a great expansion of its industrial economic base. The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed. In just nine months’ time, the new town and manufactory were completed reaching a population of 7,000. Today,",

        "Amatol, New Jersey, was built on 6,000 acres of land in the Pine Barrens. The planned community was short lived: After World War I ended that same year, Amatol became a vacant town. The homes were deserted and the plant shut down. Because most of the buildings were built to be temporary, they were dismantled and little was left behind. The factory was eventually demolished.",
        "Only two buildings from Amatol are still standing: the administration building became the now-abandoned State Police barracks outside Hammonton, and one of the houses was moved to the White Horse Pike, where it’s still occupied.\n\nInterestingly, many of Amatol’s buildings were designed to be temporary. The privately owned forest land behind the township’s recreational fields are strewn with bits of brick, concrete, and terra cotta — the materials used to construct these temporary structures."

      "question": "How did the wartime industrial production at amatol relate to the us involvement in WW1 and how did the town planning support the war effort?",
      "response": "The wartime industrial production at Amatol was directly related to the United States' involvement in World War I. After the U.S. entered the war in 1917, there was a need to rapidly expand munitions supply. In response, the government purchased 6,000 acres of land in New Jersey in 1918 and built a large munitions plant called Amatol, which produced various types of munitions, including the explosive Amatol—an invented compound used to stretch TNT supplies.\n\nThe construction of the plant and the accompanying town was a rapid and major urban planning effort, completed within nine months. The town was designed with modern amenities and infrastructure such as electric lights, sewage, water systems, schools, churches, entertainment facilities, and transportation links like the Amatol Railroad. Its purpose was to support a workforce estimated between 10,000 and 20,000 workers and their families, thereby supporting the war effort by ensuring a steady and efficient production of munitions.\n\nThe town planning played a crucial role in the war effort by providing a well-organized, self-sufficient community capable of supporting rapid industrial production. The well-designed infrastructure ensured worker safety, efficient transportation, and motivation, which were vital for the swift manufacture of munitions necessary for the war effort. After the war ended in November 1918, the plant and town were quickly dismantled, but during its short period of operation, Amatol significantly contributed to the wartime industrial mobilization of the United States.",

It purchased 6000 acres of land a few miles east of Hammonton, NJ, and built a munitions plant and a town to house the 10,000-20,000 plant workers. The plant made munitions of many different types and sizes, and was called Amatol.\n\nThe town of Amatol was built two miles away. This distance was to protect the workers and families in the event of an accident at the plant.",
        "As a result of America’s entry into World War I, Atlantic County received a great expansion of its industrial economic base. The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed. In just nine months’ time, the new town and manufactory were completed reaching a population of 7,000. Today,",
        "Development was rapid. By June, the population was nearly 2,000, and train service was added. By August, advertisements for Amatol described it as “a city with all modern improvements with electric lights, a fire department, a police department, a modern sewage system, a modern water plant, a theatre, a Y.M.C.A, an auditorium, bowling alleys, and other city amenities.” Amatol also promised many employment opportunities, not just with the munitions plant, but with local businesses, like barbers, tailors, jewelers, watchmakers, and grocers.",

It was called Amatol, and in 1918, shortly after the United States entered the war, a munitions plant and adjacent factory town were established in New Jersey named after the explosive they manufactured.",
        "She said advocates for preserving part of the Amatol tract worked for 10 years to complete the funding to make it happen, but it was only in the last year that state Green Acres funds made it possible.\nThe original Amatol site was 6,000 acres and included a grid of residential streets and worker housing sited about two miles from the munitions factories.\nIt opened in July 1918, then World War I ended Nov. 11, 1918, and the facility was shuttered and many of its buildings scrapped.",
        "The history of Amatol begins in December 1917 with the incorporation of the Atlantic Loading Company. Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected. In addition, there were also concerns over the safety of soldiers at Camp Dix",
        "This town was planned out well and was built quickly. It included a residential section consisting of houses, dormitories, bunk houses, schools and churches. The industrial section had water, electric and sewage plants. There was a bowling alley, swimming pool, YMCA, tennis courts, and a movie theater for entertainment. The Amatol Railroad was built to transport workers between the plant and town.",
        "The Army’s Ordnance Department took over the plant in February 1919 and denominated it Amatol Arsenal. By 1923, Amatol Arsenal ceased operations.\nCamp Amatol",
        "The impression given by a first view of Amatol is that of a well-kept suburban settlement. The town was not thrown together merely to put roofs and walls around its working people at night, but was built to keep its population satisfied with its surroundings and living conditions and tuned for the rapid production for which the establishment was designed.",
        "Conclusion\n\nIn just a matter of months after signing the Armistice, the population of Amatol had virtually vanished, with only a few hundred remaining there. The former munitions complex experienced a brief resurgence in 1926 after an investor backed the construction of the Atlantic City Speedway there. The revival was short-lived as interest quickly waned among the visiting public and other investors.",
        "THE TOWN OF AMATOL\n\nThe town of Amatol, which is named after one of the explosives used in the plant, covers a tract of about 350 acres lying to the northeast of the plant. A distance of upward of two miles separates the closest points between town and plant.",
        "A detailed description of the construction is recorded by Victor F. Hammel in the Construction and Operation of a Shell Loading Plant and the Town of Amatol, New Jersey, commonly known as the “Amatol book”. In total, 1,600 acres had to be cleared for the plant, and 38 acres had to be cleared and 255 acres trimmed for the town. This was no easy task. The land was mostly wooded with some acres of swamp and was difficult to clear due to a “dense, tangled nature of growth.” The initial workforce included forty men, and within the first week, the",
        "Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J.  (150 scanned pages) is a rare, oversize book that documented the building of a bomb making facility at the tail end of World War I.  Amatol was an extensive and attractive \"company town\" to support the ordnance facility. That town of 10,000 disappeared very quickly.  However, unlike so many New Jersey \"ghost towns\", this one was fully documented by the company that built it.  For anyone familiar with the site Amatol, and later, the wood board Atlantic City Speedway occupied, it is a shock to learn that there had",
        "World War I ended on Nov. 11, 1918 — Armistice Day, later commemorated as Veterans Day — and the 6,000-acre facility was soon shuttered, its buildings dismantled as swiftly as they’d been built. What little remained fell to ruin or was scrapped.\n\nMany of Amatol’s laborers, predominantly Irish and Polish from Philadelphia, stayed in the area and started families.\n\nTime, of course, has taken its toll on Amatol."

Once the lathes and the forges were working it became necessary to supply the high explosives with which to charge the shell they turned out, and to provide extensive machinery for doing the charging. Contracts were made for the production on a vast scale of trinitrotoluol, the destructive explosive used in modern big gun ammunition, and other contracts for the construction of plants for the loading of the shell as fast as the mills turned them out.",

One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made",

Even in normal times these factors are difficult problems in any large undertaking. In the early part of the year 1918, with the whole country absorbed in war work and with normal conditions completely upset, they presented ten-fold more difficulties.

In total, 1,600 acres had to be cleared for the plant, and 38 acres had to be cleared and 255 acres trimmed for the town. This was no easy task. The land was mostly wooded with some acres of swamp and was difficult to clear due to a “dense, tangled nature of growth.” The initial workforce included forty men, and within the first week, the",

      "question": "How did the development and subsequent disappearance of the Amatol munitions factory in New Jersey reflect the United States' wartime efforts during World War I, and what lasting impacts did this have on the local community and historical documentation?",
      "response": "The development and subsequent disappearance of the Amatol munitions factory in New Jersey reflected the United States' vigorous wartime efforts during World War I by exemplifying the rapid industrial mobilization and community planning necessary to support the war effort. In response to America's entry into the war in 1917, the U.S. government quickly purchased 6,000 acres of land to construct a large-scale munitions plant and a supporting town, known as Amatol. This rapid construction—completed in just nine months—demonstrated the urgency and scale of the wartime industrial response, with the facility capable of producing various types of munitions to meet the military demands.\n\nThe factory's establishment created an \"army\" of workers and a well-planned community, including residential housing and amenities, to efficiently serve the needs of the workforce. The town was strategically located two miles from the plant to enhance safety. Its existence was a concrete example of the U.S. government’s mobilization effort, utilizing urban planning and industrial infrastructure to bolster war supplies.\n\nHowever, with the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, the Amatol plant was quickly shut down, and its buildings dismantled or fell into ruin. The rapid disassembly of the facility and the town's swift disappearance reflected the war's end and the reduced need for such extensive munitions production. Many of the laborers, mostly Irish and Polish from Philadelphia, stayed in the area, contributing to the local community, but the town of Amatol itself became a ghost town.\n\nThe lasting impacts included a documented history of this brief but significant wartime effort, exemplified by the detailed records maintained by the company that built it. Locally, the remnants of Amatol served as a historical reminder of the community's role in national wartime efforts. Although the town itself is now largely deserted, recent efforts and historical documentation continue to preserve its story, and its site has transitioned through various uses, including the operation of the Atlantic City Speedway in the 1920s.\n\nIn summary, Amatol’s rise and fall encapsulate the immense mobilization for wartime production in the U.S., the rapid development driven by urgent military needs, and the transient nature of wartime communities that vanish once their purpose is fulfilled. Its history remains a testament to the scale of American industrial efforts during World War I and has left a lasting imprint on local historical records and community memory.",

      "question": "How did the Pennsylvania Railroad facilitate the rapid construction and operation of the shell loading plant near Hammonton, New Jersey, as described in the context of the Atlantic Loading Company’s activities during 1918?",
      "response": "The Pennsylvania Railroad facilitated the rapid construction and operation of the shell loading plant near Hammonton, New Jersey, primarily by providing essential transportation infrastructure. The plant was located adjacent to and north of the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads, which offered ample transportation facilities for men and materials. This strategic location on important railroad lines allowed for efficient movement of supplies, equipment, and workforce, enabling the quick transformation of the site into a major wartime industry within a few months. The railroad's infrastructure was crucial in supporting the swift development of the plant, town, and production capabilities during 1918.",

        "war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil",
        "Four large shell loading plants were projected and eventually placed in operation, namely, those of the Bethlehem Loading Co., the T. A. Gillespie Loading Co., the DuPont Engineering Co. and the Atlantic Loading Company. Of these the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company is the largest. It is located at Amatol, New Jersey—a town which came into being to house its workers, and is about 25 miles from Atlantic City, adjacent to and north of the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads. The site consists of a tract of approximately 6,000 acres of",
        "Early in the year 1918 the Company acquired for the Government a tract of 6000 acres of this land lying near the town of Hammonton, New Jersey. The Company began work on March 4th, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, laid out and built a new town and an enormous plant, peopled the former with workmen and equipped the latter with machinery and begun the loading of shell. The transformation of the wilderness into a hive of industry within such a short time was one of the many war-time marvels of American engineering achievement.",
        "A detailed description of the construction is recorded by Victor F. Hammel in the Construction and Operation of a Shell Loading Plant and the Town of Amatol, New Jersey, commonly known as the “Amatol book”. In total, 1,600 acres had to be cleared for the plant, and 38 acres had to be cleared and 255 acres trimmed for the town. This was no easy task. The land was mostly wooded with some acres of swamp and was difficult to clear due to a “dense, tangled nature of growth.” The initial workforce included forty men, and within the first week, the",
        "In March, 1918, a contract was entered into between the Ordnance  \nDepartment and the Atlantic Loading Co., under which the com-  \npany, as department agent, acquired by lease a tract of 6,000 acres  \nin southern New Jersey and erected and equipped a loading plant  \ncapable of loading 51,000 shell and 100,000 grenades per day. The  \nplant was designed for loading 75-mm, 4.7-inch, 6-inch, 8-inch, and  \n9.2-inch shell and hand and rifle grenades and drop bombs. It has  \nmagazine and warehouse facilities for 8,850,000 pounds of ammonium",
        "The history of the Atlantic Loading Company is a story of organization, construction and production in quick-step time. It entered into a contract with the Ordnance Department of the Government to act as its agent in loading and storing shell, and it conducted its work and enterprise from first to last in accordance with the rules and regulations of that department. It began the work of construction on its plant on March 4, 1918, began operations the following July, and in August loaded its first shell, and in the meantime it also had built",
        "Shell Loading to Continue Special to The Inquirer. \n\nHAMMONTON, N. J., Feb. 3.— According to Superintendent Reed, of the Atlantic Loading Company, work will be continued at the Amatol plant until May, at least. This means that shells will be loaded, but that little extra construction work will be done until further orders.",
        "MR. GRAHAM. Was it after the armistice?\nCOL. HAWKINS. No, sir; it was in September of 1918, I should think. But our original submission of the whole scheme was made in November of 1917, and the contracts were let to most of these companies on the 3rd of December, 1917, and the first one in operation that I recollect was the Gillespie Co. loading plant at Morgan, N.J., and the second one in operation was the Atlantic Loading Co. plant and the third the California loading plant; I am unable to state when the Penneman plant got into operation.",
        "It was in contemplation of this that the Atlantic Loading Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine in December, 1917. The stated purposes of the corporation were: first, to construct and operate a shell loading plant for the production of completed rounds of ammunition and to provide the necessary storage capacity therefor; second, to build a town for the housing of the operatives. The plant was designed to be the largest of its type in the country, providing for the loading of shell of all sizes from 75 mm, to 10-inch",
        "After the final determination of the site had been made, the Atlantic Loading Company immediately went to work, which caught neighboring towns by surprise. The Tuckerton Beacon reported that on March 2, 1918, the residents of Elwood and Hammonton went to bed with a quiet night as it had been any other. To their surprise, they awoke to see a large force of strangers in their midst, a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend “Ordnance Department U.S.A.,” and heavy motor trucks noisily chugging in the streets. The next day, March 4,",
        "As a result of America’s entry into World War I, Atlantic County received a great expansion of its industrial economic base. The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers’ village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed. In just nine months’ time, the new town and manufactory were completed reaching a population of 7,000. Today,",

The Atlantic Loading Co., at Hammonton, or Amatol, as we call it; the Gillespie Loading Co. plant at Morgan, near South Amboy, N.J.; that is the plant which blew up on the 4th of October, 1918; the California Loading Co. plant at Old Bridge, Va.; and one other plant in New Jersey at Mays Landing; and Penneman plant in Virginia operated by the Du Pont Co.",
        "from a local newspaper of the time.  The March 9, 1918 issue of the South Jersey Republican gives this account of the activity at the site:  \"Never in history was Hammonton so stirred up as on Sunday and Monday, when announcement was made that the Government had taken land four miles below here and proposed employing twenty thousand hands to erect buildings and load shells for war purposes.  The papers were signed Saturday noon, and Sunday nearly a half hundred army trucks, loaded with tools, lumber and supplies, passed through town to the",
        "THE PLANT\nThe Atlantic Loading Company's plant was designed to load more than 25 percent of the entire amount of shell that the Ordnance Department had placed orders for loading, assembling, and packing. It is organized to produce shell of all types, it is believed, more rapidly and with greater economy than any other plant of its kind in the United States. The men associated in this project have produced all told over 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition of various types."
