The homes were deserted and the plant shut down. Because most of the buildings were built to be temporary, they were dismantled and little was left behind. The factory was eventually demolished.\n",

Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected. In addition, there were also\n",
